    "If you walk into any walmart, TJ Maxx, of Burlington, there are entire aisles dedicated to water bottles. Many aren't by popular brands, but they vary in color, style, and size, ensuring that everytype of shopper can find something they like. Every often there a new brand emerges, taking over the scene and attracting purchases frmo all different audiences. WHen I was in middle school, S'well bottles were all the rage. A few years later Hydroflask took over, and now, Stanley and Owala seem to be th emost popular. What makes people switch from a reliable brand to another? Is it a more convenient shape, is it easier to clean, or is it just the desire to be on trend? Let's see if AI can help me design a water bottle that has all the features to attract diverse customers and maintain long-term popularity when new competitors emerge!"
