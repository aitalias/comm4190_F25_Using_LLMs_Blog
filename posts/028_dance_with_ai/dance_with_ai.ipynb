    "Creativity is a crucial component of human cognition! We intertwine logic, reason, and creativity to approach challenges every day, but sometimes we hit a roadblock and need a little bit of help. I'm choreographing a dance piece for a road trip-themed performance this semester; my theme is NJ, but I'm having trouble identifying songs that are either about NJ or written by an artist who is from NJ. Let's see if an LLM can help me identify songs that fit my musical and dance styles!"

    "\n",
    "I'm choreographing a 3.5-minute dance for my hip-hop group's show. The show is roadtripped theme, and my dance focuses on NJ. I'm creating a mix of three songs that captures the energetic vibe of NJ, Atlantic Cty, and the Jersey club scene. Help me identify songs that would be appropriate for this theme.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s such a fun concept — a New Jersey–themed dance within a “road trip” show, where your section embodies the energy, grit, and club culture of NJ! Since you’re doing a hip-hop piece and want to highlight Atlantic City + Jersey club vibes, we can blend modern Jersey club tracks, classic NJ references, and high-energy East Coast hip-hop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some song ideas you could mix and match to build a 3.5-minute track that flows from a “welcome to Jersey” intro → club energy → grand Atlantic City finale.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔊 1. Intro — “Welcome to New Jersey” (0:30–0:45)\n",
    "\n",
    "Set the scene like you’ve just “arrived” in NJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Livin’ on a Prayer” – Bon Jovi (spoken intro or first hook) → iconic NJ rock band. You could distort or remix it for a clever sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound FX: Highway sounds, GPS saying “Entering New Jersey,” toll booth beeps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative: Use a quick vocal clip like “Welcome to New Jersey” or something referencing the Garden State.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎧 2. Jersey Club Energy Section (1:00–2:00)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your core: fast-paced, bouncy, footwork-heavy section that screams Newark / Jersey club culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Jersey Club artists & remixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIIQU3 – “Microdosing” / “Phase 3” / “Trunk”\n",
    "\n",
    "DJ Sliink – “Put Cha Back In It” / “Higher”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookiee Kawaii – “Vibe (If I Back It Up)” (TikTok hit but pure Jersey club DNA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandmanrill – “Real Hips” or “Fifty” (Jersey club + drill fusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Coi Leray – “Players” (DJ Smallz 732 Jersey Club Remix) – perfect nod to a NJ artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "DJ Jayhood – “Heartbroken” (Jersey Club Remix) – an OG club anthem.\n",
    "\n",
    "🎰 3. Atlantic City / Boardwalk Energy (2:00–3:00)\n",
    "\n",
    "Glamorous but gritty casino-city vibe — think flashy, confident, hip-hop swagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetty Wap – “Trap Queen” (Patterson, NJ native; recognizable, fun)\n",
    "\n",
    "Redman – “Let’s Get Dirty” or “Tonight’s Da Night” (classic NJ hip-hop energy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Queen Latifah – “U.N.I.T.Y.” (if you want a nod to NJ hip-hop royalty)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lizzo – “2 Be Loved (Am I Ready)” (Jersey Club Remix) — adds pop appeal + danceable bounce.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could even sample casino sounds (slot machines, dice rolls, chips clinking) in the transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "🏁 4. Finale / Outro (3:00–3:30)\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap it up with a “party still going” energy or a nod back to the road trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitney Houston – “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” (Jersey Club Remix) → powerhouse NJ icon, joyful close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a Bon Jovi “It’s My Life” Jersey Club Remix (plenty exist) for a fun, full-circle moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "this style of this dance is hip hop and my choreography style is fast and high energy. i don't think bon jovi or whitney houston fit this. i also  want  the order to be \"welcome to new jersey, atlantic city, finish with jersey club. can you adjust your recommendations accordingly.\n",
