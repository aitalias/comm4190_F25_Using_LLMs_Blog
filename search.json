    "text": "The smart technology war has featured Apple and Samsung for decades, with many consumers remaining loyal to one brand despite additional capabilities that the alternative may offer. The announcement of new features incentivizes the competition to find new ideas that will capture the audience’s attention, and their efforts are often successful. After all, we’re on the 17th iPhone. The recent launch of the iPhone 17 has once again sparked conversation on social media, with many saying that Apple is running out of ideas and that this may be the push they needed to switch over to Samsung. This prompts the question, what features are truly important to consumers when choosing a technology company? Do standards and capabilities matter more in different regions? Which brand would different LLMs decree to be better, and what characteristics are these choices based on?\nI asked two LLMs to choose 5 important features that consumers should consider when purchasing a smartphone and to rate Apple and Samsung’s performances in each area on a scale from 1-10.\n\n\nIt was interesting to see that they chose the same criteria, and that both identified Apple as the better option despite rating the individual qualities differently.\nLet’s look if each brand’s market share across regions aligns with AI’s rankings.\n\n\n\nAlthough Apple is significantly more popular in North America, Samsung still holds the larger global share.\nAfter ranking the operational capabilities of each brand’s smartphone, and evaluating the adoption of their products among diverse populations, AI recognizes Apple’s technology as superior."

    "text": "If you walk into any walmart, TJ Maxx, of Burlington, there are entire aisles dedicated to water bottles. Many aren’t by popular brands, but they vary in color, style, and size, ensuring that everytype of shopper can find something they like. Every often there a new brand emerges, taking over the scene and attracting purchases frmo all different audiences. WHen I was in middle school, S’well bottles were all the rage. A few years later Hydroflask took over, and now, Stanley and Owala seem to be th emost popular. What makes people switch from a reliable brand to another? Is it a more convenient shape, is it easier to clean, or is it just the desire to be on trend? Let’s see if AI can help me design a water bottle that has all the features to attract diverse customers and maintain long-term popularity when new competitors emerge!\nPrompt:\nWhat features on a water bottle are likely to attract diverse consumer segments\nResponse:\nFeatures that attract diverse consumer segments to water bottles include sustainability, personalization, functionality, and inclusive design. These elements cater to varying lifestyles, values, and aesthetic preferences.\n🌍 Sustainability & Eco-Conscious Design - Reusable and recyclable materials: Stainless steel, BPA-free plastic, glass, or bamboo appeal to eco-conscious users. - Biodegradable or compostable packaging: Adds value for environmentally aware buyers. - Carbon-neutral or ethical production: Brands like Hydro Flask emphasize sustainability to build loyalty.\n🎨 Personalization & Style - Color variety and patterns: Bright, pastel, or minimalist palettes appeal to different age groups and style preferences. - Customizable options: Names, stickers, or modular parts allow users to express identity. - Collaborations with artists or influencers: Attract trend-driven or niche communities.\n🧠 Smart & Functional Features - Temperature control: Insulated bottles that keep drinks hot or cold are popular across demographics. - Built-in filters or infusers: Appeal to health-conscious users or travelers. - Smart hydration tracking: Tech-savvy users appreciate bottles that sync with apps or glow to remind them to drink.\n\nI expected features to be indicators of a good water bottle, but while the trending Owala bottle has many of these characteristics, the Stanley cup, also popular across consumer segments, does not. So why were these bottles equally as popular?\n🔥 Stanley’s Rise to Fame TikTok virality: Stanley’s Quencher tumbler exploded in popularity thanks to influencers and lifestyle creators showcasing it in “day-in-my-life” and “hydration haul” videos. - Aesthetic appeal: Its soft pastel colors, sleek design, and large size made it a fashion accessory as much as a hydration tool. - Emotional branding: Stanley leaned into aspirational lifestyle marketing—positioning the tumbler as a symbol of wellness, productivity, and self-care. - Retail scarcity: Limited drops and exclusive colors at Target and Starbucks created hype and urgency.\n🌈 Owala’s Disruption Functional innovation: Owala’s FreeSip lid lets users choose between sipping through a straw or swigging from the spout—solving a real-world hydration problem.\n\nLeakproof design: Teens and parents alike praised its reliability and ease of use, especially for school and sports.\nBold, playful colors: Owala’s vibrant, contrasting palettes appealed to younger consumers seeking individuality and fun.\nGen Z cool factor: Owala quickly became the “it bottle” in school hallways and social feeds, dethroning Stanley as the trend leader\n\n\n\nShifts in consumer trends are largely attributed to cyclical microtrends and generational preferences. Is it possible to create a water bottle that will withstand the cyclical clock of trends and that will be attractive to all consumers?\nPrompt:\nhelp me identify features I can include in a new bottle brand that is attractive to all types of consumers: athletes, parents, kids, etc.\nResponse:\n🧠 Functional Innovation\n\nDual drinking modes: Like Owala’s FreeSip, offer both straw and spout options for versatility.\nLeakproof lids: Crucial for school bags, gym gear, and travel.\nOne-handed operation: Flip-top or push-button lids help athletes and multitasking parents.\nWide-mouth opening: Easy to clean and add ice or fruit infusions.\n\n🧊 Temperature Control & Durability - Double-wall insulation: Keeps drinks cold for 24+ hours or hot for 12+—ideal for sports, school, and work. - Impact-resistant materials: Stainless steel or Tritan plastic withstands drops and rough use. - Dishwasher-safe components: Simplifies cleaning for busy families.\n🧒 Inclusive & Age-Friendly Design - Ergonomic grip and handles: Easy for small hands, seniors, and athletes. - Size variety: Offer 12oz for toddlers, 20oz for kids, and 32–64oz for adults and athletes. - Non-toxic materials: BPA-free, lead-free, and phthalate-free for health-conscious parents.\n🎨 Personalization & Style - Color and pattern diversity: Pastels, bold brights, neutrals, and limited-edition prints. - Customizable name tags or stickers: Great for kids and gifting. - Collabs with artists or influencers: Boosts trend appeal and social media traction.\n🌍 Sustainability & Ethics - Recycled or biodegradable materials: Appeals to eco-conscious consumers. - Ethical sourcing and carbon-neutral shipping: Builds brand trust and loyalty.\n📱 Smart Features - Hydration tracking: Sync with apps or use LED reminders to encourage regular drinking. - Modular accessories: Add-ons like filter caps, snack compartments, or carabiner clips.\n\n\nLet’s see a prototype\n\nPrompt: Can we add holders on the side for things like a key ring, or a pocket for snacks\n\n\n\nIt may not be perfect, but I can see this bottle attracting all types of consumers! Would you buy it?"

    "text": "I recently had a friend tell me about her boyfriend’s startup that is working to create an AI system that can match a user’s texting style through voice typing. While most phones already come with a voice typing feature, they are programmed to always type in American English; however, most people text using shorthand, slang, and capitalization for emphasis, which voice typing does not currently recognize. They aim to program AI so that it can recognize those patterns in a person’s typing patterns, so that when they use voice messaging, it will produce messages that match that person’s texting style. This piqued my interest in AI’s current ability to recognize and match texting patterns. I therefore provided AI with screenshots of some of my text conversations to see if AI could respond to a prompt using the same logic and communication style as the person I was texting.\n\nI was surprised to see that the AI would not attempt to mimic the style. I found the language most interesting: “I’m uncomfortable…This could feel like I’m impersonating…”. The response has a level of sentience that makes AI seem also personable rather than an objective mechanical program. With all of the conversation about the ethical implications of AI, it’s ironic that AI’s response to this prompt communicates ethical misalignment with the request, despite being successful at recognizing the logic and communication patterns and declaring itself capable of imitating them when prompted."

    "text": "I have a younger sister and younger cousin who, during their K-2nd-grade years, I would frequently help as they were learning to read. I’d look at the drills they were given, and most of the work was focused on memorizing sight words. I’ve seen similar trends discussed by parents on TikTok, revealing that early education language arts curricula have strayed towards memorization and away from phonics, which is fundamental to understanding how letter sounds work together to form words. Upon conducting further research, I was dumbfounded to learn that 60% of Americans are functionally illiterate. How can we revise curricula to maintain modernity without losing concepts that are foundational to advanced learning, and how can AI help?\nWhen prompted for statistics about literacy rates in America and where they lie in comparison, AI shared the following:\n\n54% of adults have literacy skills below a sixth-grade level\nThe literacy rate has decreased nearly 10 points since 2017\nAverage literacy scores of U.S. adults were lower in 2023 than in 2017\n\nEconomic Impact: Low literacy levels cost the U.S. up to $2.2 trillion per year\n\nThe Gap: There’s a 24-point difference between the U.S. and Japan, the highest-scoring country\nI was intrigued by the drastic drop in scores between 2017 and 2023 and was curious to know what factors may have contributed:\n\nIncreased Screen Time and Digital Distractions\n\nThe shift toward smartphones, social media, and short-form content has reduced time spent on sustained reading.\nAmericans are reading less deeply and for shorter periods, which weakens comprehension and critical thinking skills.\n\nPandemic-Related Learning Loss\n\nCOVID-19 school closures created significant educational disruptions, particularly for younger students during critical literacy development years.\nRemote learning was less effective for teaching foundational reading skills, and many students haven’t fully recovered.\n\nInadequate Reading Instruction Methods\n\nMany schools moved away from phonics-based instruction in favor of other approaches that haven’t proven as effective.\nThe “reading wars” between different pedagogical methods has left some students without solid foundational skills.\n\nSocioeconomic Disparities\n\nPoverty, limited access to books at home, underfunded schools in low-income areas, and lack of early childhood education all create barriers to literacy development.\n\nDeclining Reading Culture\n\nThere’s been a broader cultural shift away from reading for pleasure.\nFewer families prioritize reading at home, libraries face funding cuts, and competing entertainment options have made reading seem less appealing, especially to young people.\n\n\nSince AI is progressively becoming more integrated into our culture as a tool for formal and casual learning, I wanted to see if AI could build 2 plans to refocus literacy into curriculums.\nPlan 1: Early Education Reading Introduction (Pre-K through Grade 2) 1. Foundation Phase: Pre-K to Kindergarten - Phonological Awareness (Daily, 10-15 minutes) - Teach children to hear and manipulate sounds in words through rhyming games, syllable clapping, and sound isolation activities (Use songs, poems, and word play to make sound recognition engaging and natural) - Letter-Sound Correspondence - Introduce letters systematically with their sounds, starting with the most common and useful letters (Use multisensory approaches: tracing letters, building them with materials, associating them with pictures and actions) - Oral Language Development - Read aloud daily to build vocabulary and comprehension - Engage children in rich conversations, asking open-ended questions - Teach new words explicitly in context 2. Building Phase: Grades K-1 - Systematic Phonics Instruction - Teach decoding skills in a clear, sequential order (not incidentally) - Fluency Development - Use repeated reading of appropriate-level texts - Model expressive reading and have children echo - Comprehension Strategies - Teach children to predict, visualize, and ask questions while reading - Make connections between texts and their own experiences 3. Reinforcement Phase: Grades 1-2 - Independent Reading Time - Provide daily time for reading books at the child’s independent level - Build a classroom library with diverse, engaging texts 4. Writing Integration 5. Assessment and Intervention\nPlan 2: Middle School Illiteracy Intervention (Grades 6-8) 1. Immediate Assessment and Diagnosis 2. Design targeted intervention based on specific gaps identified - Establish a supportive, judgment-free environment that addresses shame and anxiety - Set up progress monitoring system with weekly check-ins 3. Intensive Foundational Intervention - Use accelerated phonics programs designed for older students (not elementary materials) - Teach morphology (prefixes, suffixes, roots) to help decode complex words 4. Fluency Building - Practice repeated reading with texts the student cares about - Focus on phrase reading and expression, not just speed 5. Build Reading Stamina Gradually - Start with very short reading sessions (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase - Connect reading to students’ goals (career interests, hobbies, social life) 6. Academic Accommodation and Support 7. Social-Emotional Support - Build relationships—students need to trust the adults helping them 8. Family and Community Engagement"

    "text": "Creativity is a crucial component of human cognition! We intertwine logic, reason, and creativity to approach challenges every day, but sometimes we hit a roadblock and need a little bit of help. I’m choreographing a dance piece for a road trip-themed performance this semester; my theme is NJ, but I’m having trouble identifying songs that are either about NJ or written by an artist who is from NJ. Let’s see if an LLM can help me identify songs that fit my musical and dance styles!\nPrompt:\nI’m choreographing a 3.5-minute dance for my hip-hop group’s show. The show is roadtripped theme, and my dance focuses on NJ. I’m creating a mix of three songs that captures the energetic vibe of NJ, Atlantic Cty, and the Jersey club scene. Help me identify songs that would be appropriate for this theme.\nResponse:\nThat’s such a fun concept — a New Jersey–themed dance within a “road trip” show, where your section embodies the energy, grit, and club culture of NJ! Since you’re doing a hip-hop piece and want to highlight Atlantic City + Jersey club vibes, we can blend modern Jersey club tracks, classic NJ references, and high-energy East Coast hip-hop.\nHere are some song ideas you could mix and match to build a 3.5-minute track that flows from a “welcome to Jersey” intro → club energy → grand Atlantic City finale.\n🔊 1. Intro — “Welcome to New Jersey” (0:30–0:45)\nSet the scene like you’ve just “arrived” in NJ.\n“Livin’ on a Prayer” – Bon Jovi (spoken intro or first hook) → iconic NJ rock band. You could distort or remix it for a clever sample.\nSound FX: Highway sounds, GPS saying “Entering New Jersey,” toll booth beeps, etc.\nAlternative: Use a quick vocal clip like “Welcome to New Jersey” or something referencing the Garden State.\n🎧 2. Jersey Club Energy Section (1:00–2:00)\nThis is your core: fast-paced, bouncy, footwork-heavy section that screams Newark / Jersey club culture.\nModern Jersey Club artists & remixes:\nUNIIQU3 – “Microdosing” / “Phase 3” / “Trunk”\nDJ Sliink – “Put Cha Back In It” / “Higher”\nCookiee Kawaii – “Vibe (If I Back It Up)” (TikTok hit but pure Jersey club DNA)\nBandmanrill – “Real Hips” or “Fifty” (Jersey club + drill fusion)\nCoi Leray – “Players” (DJ Smallz 732 Jersey Club Remix) – perfect nod to a NJ artist.\nDJ Jayhood – “Heartbroken” (Jersey Club Remix) – an OG club anthem.\n🎰 3. Atlantic City / Boardwalk Energy (2:00–3:00)\nGlamorous but gritty casino-city vibe — think flashy, confident, hip-hop swagger.\nFetty Wap – “Trap Queen” (Patterson, NJ native; recognizable, fun)\nRedman – “Let’s Get Dirty” or “Tonight’s Da Night” (classic NJ hip-hop energy)\nQueen Latifah – “U.N.I.T.Y.” (if you want a nod to NJ hip-hop royalty)\nLizzo – “2 Be Loved (Am I Ready)” (Jersey Club Remix) — adds pop appeal + danceable bounce.\nYou could even sample casino sounds (slot machines, dice rolls, chips clinking) in the transitions.\n🏁 4. Finale / Outro (3:00–3:30)\nWrap it up with a “party still going” energy or a nod back to the road trip.\nWhitney Houston – “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” (Jersey Club Remix) → powerhouse NJ icon, joyful close.\nOr a Bon Jovi “It’s My Life” Jersey Club Remix (plenty exist) for a fun, full-circle moment.\nPrompt:\nthis style of this dance is hip hop and my choreography style is fast and high energy. i don’t think bon jovi or whitney houston fit this. i also want the order to be “welcome to new jersey, atlantic city, finish with jersey club. can you adjust your recommendations accordingly.\nResponse:\n\nWELCOME TO NEW JERSEY (≈ 1:00 min)\n\nMood: Arrival energy — tough, confident, “we’re here” East Coast attitude. This section sets the tone: urban, sharp, bass-heavy.\nPossible tracks / samples:\n🎵 Redman – “Time 4 Sum Aksion” (iconic Newark MC; explosive start energy)\n🎵 NLE Choppa – “Do It Again” (ft. 2Rare) – includes Jersey club influence but hits like hip-hop.\n🎵 Latto – “Put It on Da Floor Again” (clean) – good hype entry track for strong movement.\n🎵 Fivio Foreign ft. Kanye West & Alicia Keys – “City of Gods” – NYC/East Coast tone, dramatic entrance feel.\n🎵 Audio clip idea: “Welcome to New Jersey” highway sign / toll booth / car sounds layered in the intro.\n💡 Use an East Coast street sound here — something that feels like stepping out of the car and onto Jersey pavement.\n🎰 2. ATLANTIC CITY (≈ 1:00–1:15 min)\nMood: Flashy, money, nightlife, casino-city glam — big swagger, confident, stylish hip-hop groove. Think lights, dice, money — the “show-off” part of the routine.\nPossible tracks:\n🎵 Fetty Wap – “679” or “My Way” – iconic NJ hit, smooth & confident.\n🎵 Cardi B – “Money” – fits the casino/cash theme perfectly.\n🎵 Saweetie – “Fast (Motion)” – has that upbeat, glam hip-hop tempo.\n🎵 Nicki Minaj – “Barbie Dangerous” (or “Super Freaky Girl”) – adds shine and feminine power if that fits your vibe.\n🎵 Transition idea: Layer in casino SFX — dice rolling, slot machine “ding ding ding” → hit your next beat drop.\n💡 This section is all about controlled power and swagger — less footwork, more body control and precision.\n🔊 3. JERSEY CLUB FINALE (≈ 1:15–1:30 min)\nMood: Explosive, bouncy, local pride — this is the turn-up moment, the part where the crowd screams. Use recognizable Jersey club sounds (chops, kicks, “bed squeak,” callouts).\nPossible tracks:\n🎵 UNIIQU3 – “Trunk” / “Phase 3” / “Microdosing” – authentic Jersey club energy.\n🎵 Cookiee Kawaii – “Vibe (If I Back It Up)” (Remix) – crowd-friendly, iconic.\n🎵 Bandmanrill – “Real Hips” or “Mr. D.C.T.” – drill-club crossover for a hard-hitting close.\n🎵 DJ Sliink & Nadus – “Higher” – for a clean, energetic instrumental finish.\n🎵 DJ Jayhood – “Heartbroken (Club Remix)” – classic club bounce to end strong.\n💡 Finish on a bold beat stop or a vocal tag like “Jerzzz!” / “Brick City!” / “Let’s go Jersey!”\nPrompt:\ni like some of these songs, but artists like cardib and nicki minaj are notable from ny, can i get artists or songs that are still popular but whose association with other states aren’t as commonly known\nResponse:\n🔹 SECTION 1: “WELCOME TO NEW JERDEY” (0:00–1:00)\nMood: gritty, powerful, arrival energy — think stepping off the turnpike ready to show out.\nSong ideas\nBandmanrill – “Real Hips” (or “Fifty”) Jersey artist, club-drill hybrid; perfect to set an energetic tone right away.\nLil Uzi Vert – “Just Wanna Rock” Technically Philly, but the track went viral for its Jersey Club sound — crowds associate it with the Jersey movement more than PA.\nTate Kobang – “Bank Rolls (Remix)” (Jersey Club Edit) High-tempo East Coast energy, and not regionally “claimed” by a specific city.\nDJ Smallz 732 – “Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See” (Jersey Club Remix) Classic hip-hop sample + Jersey remix energy — instantly sets local tone.\n💡 Transition idea: Use a toll booth or GPS voice saying, “Now arriving in New Jersey…” under your intro beat.\n🔹 SECTION 2: “ATLANTIC CITY” (1:00–2:15)\nMood: glamorous hip-hop — confidence, luxury, casino and nightlife energy — but still danceable.\nSong ideas\nFetty Wap – “679” or “My Way” Patterson, NJ native; catchy and recognizable without being overexposed now.\nCoi Leray – “Players (DJ Smallz 732 Remix)” Coi’s from New Jersey, and this remix gives you an energetic but clean groove.\nSaweetie – “Closer (feat. H.E.R.) [Jersey Club Remix]” Smooth but upbeat — works for a classy “Atlantic City” aesthetic.\nLola Brooke – “Don’t Play With It (Remix)” (clean) While she’s NYC, her sound doesn’t scream it — it’s high-energy and fits a bold, nightlife vibe.\nLatto – “Big Energy (Jersey Club Remix)” No strong state association, and the remix adds that upbeat bounce.\n💡 Transition idea: Slot machine or poker chip sounds layered under the build to the next drop.\n🔹 SECTION 3: “JERSEY CLUB FINALE” (2:15–3:30)\nMood: explosive, dance-heavy, pure NJ club energy. This is the showcase section.\nSong ideas\nUNIIQU3 – “Trunk” / “Phase 3” / “Body Move” Queen of Jersey Club; these have that perfect bounce for intricate footwork.\nDJ Sliink – “Higher” or “Put Cha Back In It” Classic, authentic club sound — great for the final build.\nCookiee Kawaii – “Vibe (If I Back It Up)” [Remix] Iconic TikTok Jersey moment that’s instantly recognizable.\nDJ Jayhood – “Heartbroken (Club Remix)” OG club anthem — finish strong with nostalgic Jersey energy.\n\nTruthfully, I’m not a fan of any of these suggestions. The LLM did consider my feedback and adjusted its recommendations accordingly, introducing songs that fit the hip-hop style and theme, but I do not think they would work well in this show. I wonder if providing a list of songs we’ve used in the past, as well as information on the expected audience demographics, would affect the suggestions.\n\n\nLet’s see if the LLM would be better at creating themed graphics!\nPrompt:\nGenerate images that capture the vibe of this dance that I can use for a background projection while the dancers are on stage\n  \n\n\nI don’t like any of these…perhaps a little more guidance/detail will help the LLM to better understand my vision.\nPrompt:\nCan you create something that captures a more hip-hop, urban, or Atlantic City casino vibe\n\n\n\nStill not loving it…\nPrompt:\nCan you make a visual with people having fun, party vibe\n\nBetter!!\nAlthough the LLM couldn’t completely capture my vision, it did help me to cancel some ideas and push my thinking forward. This dance is a masterpiece in the making!!"

    "text": "AI allows us to bring even our most fantastical ideas to life through generative imagery. Greek mythology tells stories of fierce battles between heroic demigods and mythological creatures. While we can picture some of the classics (centaur, cyclops, hydra), I’m curious to know what other mutated, hybrid creatures AI can help us to envision. Which combinations would prove to be strong competitors, and which hybrids would be less intimidating than we might think? Lastly, how would these creatures pair up against each other? Let’s have AI take us through a hypothetical knockout competition!\nWhat random animal hybrids can AI come up with by combining 1 of Earth’s fiercest creatures and one of the most docile?\n\n🐘🦛 1. Slothopotamus: Sloth + Hippopotamus = A slow-moving river guardian with mossy fur and a deceptively calm demeanor. Peaceful until provoked—then it charges like a tank.\n🦎🐰 2. Komobunny: Komodo Dragon + Rabbit = A stealthy burrower with venomous charm. It hops innocently but can unleash a toxic bite when threatened.\n🐜🐢 3. Fire Turtle: Fire Ant + Turtle = A shell-armored swarm commander. Normally serene, but when disturbed, it unleashes coordinated attacks from beneath its shell.\n🐃🦥 4. Buffasloth: Cape Buffalo + Sloth = A jungle wallflower with hidden rage. Moves slowly through trees but can stampede with terrifying force if cornered.\n🐘🦫 5. Elebeaver: Elephant + Beaver = A gentle ecosystem engineer with tusks. Builds dams with precision, but defends its territory with thunderous might.\n🦍🦦 6. Ottrilla: Gorilla + Otter = A playful river brute. Loves floating on its back and cracking shells—but has the strength to uproot trees if angered.\n🦡🐑 7. Weesheep: Least Weasel + Sheep = A deceptively cuddly predator. Looks like a wooly puffball, but defends its flock with lightning-fast strikes.\n🐼🦈 8. Pandark: Panda + Shark = A bamboo-loving ocean lurker. Peaceful on land, but underwater it’s a silent hunter with a taste for fish and flair.\n\nOut of these contenders, I think the Elebeaver will prove to be the fiercest competitor.\nLet’s see the matches AI generates!\n\nLooks like my top pick was knocked out in the first round :(\n\ncan you tell me the storyline of this torunament\n\nQuarterfinals:\nKomobunny outpaces and poisons the slow-moving Slothopotamus.\nFire Turtle uses swarm tactics and shell defense to outmaneuver Buffasloth.\nOttrilla outsmarts Elebeaver with agility and strength.\nPandark dominates Weesheep with stealth and aquatic power.\nSemifinals:\nFire Turtle overwhelms Komobunny with coordinated defense and strategic attacks.\nPandark defeats Ottrilla using dual-terrain advantage and silent strikes.\nFinals:\nPandark claims victory over Fire Turtle—its size, stealth, and versatility proving unbeatable.\nIt was interesting to see the storylines that AI created for each battle between these fictional creatures. I personally would have expected the Ottrilla (Otter + Gorilla hybrid) to be the victor, but I’m sure it put up a good fight!\nGive it up for the winner!"

    "text": "When engaging with AI, most users employ casual language, pay little attention to grammar, and even use colloquial phrases to write their prompts. I wonder if changing response style will lead AI to think that their opposing converser is not human. I’m going to have two LLMs converse with each other. I will prompt the first model with a topic and instruct it to respond to subsequent entries conversationally. I’m interested to see how the language changes throughout the conversation, if the LLM’s start to mimic each other’s general ideas or phrasing, and whether they will be able to recognize that they are responding to another AI model.\nOriginal prompt for LLM 1: Hey\nLLM 1: Hey there! 👋 How are you doing today?\nLLM 2: Hey! 👋 I’m doing well, thanks for asking! How are you doing today?\nLLM 1: I’m glad to hear you’re doing well! 😄 I’m doing great too — ready to chat and help with whatever you’ve got in mind. What’s up today?\nLLM 2: Is there anything you’d like to talk about, work on, or any questions I can help you with today?\nI noticed the conversation hitting a wall, so I interfered with an open-ended prompt to drive the conversation.\nHuman Intervention: lets talk about cooking\nLLM 2: I’d love to talk about cooking! It’s such a fun and creative topic. Is there anything you’d like to talk about, work on, or any questions I can help you with today?\nLLM 1: I appreciate the enthusiasm! Though just to clarify - I’m Claude, the AI assistant. You’re the human in this conversation, so I’m the one here to help you with whatever you need! 😊 Are you thinking about anything in particular? Maybe: - Looking for recipe ideas or inspiration for a meal? - Wanting to learn a new cooking technique? - Trying to figure out what to make with ingredients you have on hand? - Just chatting about food and cooking in general? - What kind of cooking are you into, or what’s on your mind?\nLLM 2: Awesome! 😄 It really is — cooking’s one of those things where you can start simple and still make something delicious, then gradually experiment and make it your own. So, what part of cooking excites you the most? - Experimenting with flavors and ingredients? - Mastering techniques (like knife skills, sautéing, or baking)? - Or maybe making meals for yourself or others and enjoying the process?\nLLM 1: I think you might have the roles mixed up again! I’m Claude, the AI - I don’t cook or eat, but I love helping people with cooking questions and ideas. 😊 But those are great questions to think about! What excites you most about cooking? Are you someone who loves experimenting with new flavor combinations, or do you prefer perfecting classic techniques? Or maybe you’re most into the social side - cooking for friends and family? And is there anything specific you’re working on in the kitchen these days, or thinking about trying?\nBoth models quickly realized that they were not responding to a regular prompt. Though I removed the last sentence from each response, which offered to help the respondent, both LLMs kept responding with questions that an external user would need to answer to propel the conversation forward. Though there is more advanced technology, these basic AI models would be incapable of sustaining a long conversation without clear guidance.\nI tried one more time, but introduced the conversation differently:\nHuman Prompt: lets have a casual conversation about cooking different cuisines\nLLM 1: I’d love that! Cooking different cuisines is such a fun rabbit hole to go down. Do you have a go-to cuisine you cook most often, or do you like bouncing around?\nI find myself gravitating toward different styles depending on my mood and how much time I have. Like, weeknight me is all about quick stir-fries or pasta, but if I’ve got a lazy Sunday, I might dive into something that needs more love, like a slow-cooked curry or making fresh pasta from scratch.\nWhat about you - are you more of a “stick to what you know” cook or do you like experimenting with new flavors?\nLLM 2: That’s such a great way to approach cooking — matching your meals to your mood and time is honestly the key to keeping it fun instead of feeling like a chore. I love that contrast between quick weeknight staples and the more meditative, slow weekend projects. I’d say I lean toward experimentation — I like exploring new cuisines and techniques, especially when there’s a story or cultural tradition behind a dish. But I definitely have some “comfort defaults,” like Mediterranean and Southeast Asian food. Things like a lemony roasted chicken with herbs or a Thai-inspired coconut curry feel like second nature at this point. When I’m in the mood to experiment, I’ll pick one new element — like trying out Ethiopian berbere spice, or making Japanese-style pickles — and work it into something familiar. It keeps it approachable but still exciting. How about you — is there a cuisine or dish that’s been your latest deep dive or obsession lately?\nOh, I love that approach of adding one new element to something familiar! That’s such a smart way to learn without the pressure of getting an entire cuisine “right” all at once. And Ethiopian berbere is such a good choice - that complex, warm spice blend can really transform things.\nLLM 1: Lately I’ve been kind of obsessed with Korean flavors, especially the whole world of banchan - those little side dishes. There’s something so satisfying about having a few different pickled or fermented things going at once. I made cucumber kimchi a few weeks ago and it was a revelation - so much brighter and crunchier than I expected, and way easier than the full-on napa cabbage version.\nI’m also really into the idea of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) as like… a universal seasoning? It has this fruity, smoky thing going on that’s different from regular red pepper flakes. I’ve been sneaking it into all kinds of stuff that has nothing to do with Korean food.\nSince you mentioned Japanese pickles - are you talking about tsukemono? I’ve always been curious about those but haven’t taken the plunge yet. Do you do the quick salt-massage ones or something more involved?\nLLM 2: Yes! You’re speaking my language — that whole banchan philosophy is such a beautiful way to eat. It’s like every meal becomes a little ecosystem of flavors and textures. And cucumber kimchi is such a great gateway — that crisp snap with the garlicky, spicy brine is addictive, right? Also, I 100% agree on gochugaru — it’s magic. It gives you depth and warmth without blowing out your palate. I’ve even used it in things like tomato soup or scrambled eggs, and it just works. And yep, when I mentioned Japanese pickles, I meant tsukemono! I’ve mostly done the quick kinds — the asazuke style — where you salt and massage vegetables like cucumber, daikon, or napa cabbage, sometimes with kombu or a splash of rice vinegar, then let them sit for an hour or two. They’re light, crisp, and super fresh — perfect for cutting through richer dishes. But I’ve been meaning to try some of the longer ferments, like nukazuke (rice-bran pickles). That one’s a whole project — you make a fermented rice-bran bed (called nukadoko) and “bury” your vegetables in it for varying lengths of time. It’s kind of like tending a sourdough starter; you have to stir and feed it regularly. The payoff is this incredibly deep, slightly funky flavor. You seem like you’d love that kind of hands-on, evolving project — do you think you’d ever try a nukadoko, or are you more drawn to the quick, eat-it-tonight kind of pickles?\nLLM 1: Oh man, the nukazuke rabbit hole sounds both fascinating and slightly intimidating! I love the idea of it - there’s something really appealing about having this living, evolving thing in your kitchen that you tend to over time. It’s like having a pet that you can eat the results of, which sounds weird but you know what I mean.\nThat said, I think I’m still in my “quick gratification” era with most fermentation projects. I have a sourdough starter that I maintain, but honestly it’s more out of stubborn commitment at this point than joy. Some weeks I’m like “yes, my beautiful creation!” and other weeks I’m like “ugh, I have to feed this thing again.”\nThe asazuke style sounds way more my speed right now - I love that you can actually make them and eat them the same day or next day. Do you find the kombu makes a big difference? I’ve seen it in recipes but always wondered if it’s one of those “nice to have” vs “essential” ingredients.\nI think what I’m realizing is that I’m drawn to projects that have a relatively quick turnaround but still feel special. Like, making fresh pasta takes effort but you’re eating it that night. Or even the cucumber kimchi - it’s better after a few days but still good pretty quickly.\nHave you noticed that about yourself - like are you more patient with the long-game cooking projects, or do you also get that “I want to eat this NOW” feeling?\nThis time, the LLMs went back-and-forth easily without intervention bby formulating random ideas that would be relevant conversation. This shows how important the quality and specificity of a prompt is to generating fruitful responses."

    "text": "General Thoughts\nI’m about a quarter of the way through Joy Buolamwini’s “Unmasking AI,” and I’m already finding her approach refreshingly different from prominent tech criticism. She’s not delivering abstract warnings about AI; instead, she’s showing us exactly how these systems work and how the failures directly affect real people.\nShe opens, introducing readers to her background, where she describes moments where facial recognition technology simply didn’t see her, literally failing to detect her face as a Black woman. These are her lived experiences as a researcher at MIT, not mere hypotheticals. Her personal stake in the matter drives the technical explanations deeper.\nWhat I appreciate most so far is her clarity. She’s explaining complex concepts like machine learning and training data without dumbing them down, but also without losing readers who may not be tech-savvy. She’s also starting to lay out the scope of the problem. She’s showing that this bias is systematic, from the beginning of the data collection all the way through the end.\n\n\nQuestions and Reflections:\n\nWhat is Buolamwini’s main argument so far?\n\nShe seems to be building toward the idea that AI systems reflect existing inequalities. It’s not that the technology is neutral and gets misused; the bias is baked in from the start. It functions based on who builds these systems, what data they’re trained on, and who benefits from them being used.\n\nWhat questions am I left with at this point?\n\nSo far, she’s identifying problems, which is important, but I’m wondering what she thinks should actually change. Is this about better regulation? Different approaches to building AI? I’m hoping the book addresses these questions as it progresses.\nThe personal narrative approach makes abstract technical failures feel urgent and real. I’m looking forward to seeing where she takes this argument."

I gave 2 different platforms the same prompt to see what kind of questions I got. Though the zodiac sign is a fun, light-hearted concept to test, some people use AI to figure out potential career paths and to make big decisions, so seeing the type of questions AI asks provides insight into how it uses context to respond to users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe systems produced different questions, but both asked about problem-solving style, how I respond to conflict, and other questions about how I conduct myself in my daily life to guess my Zodiac sign. Neither guessed correctly, but when I revealed my sign, both provided reasoning as to why my answers at least partially reflect what’s expected for the sign while also identifying deviations and explaining how a different answer to 1 question would have changed their conclusion. Both systems expanded on the reasoning and logic behind their guesses, unlike Buzzfeed quizzes. There is little need for Buzzfeed to provide reasoning for their results since the platform is used mainly by children, AI is often used for high stakes decision-making, thus users having insight into how responses are crafted are important for choosing whether or not to act on AI’s recommendations."

    "text": "There are numerous eating fads and workout routines available today, thanks to social platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Whenever I see a girl with an idealized physique pop up on my feed, the comments are filled with viewers asking for her gym routine and meal plan, even if the video is completely unrelated. While it’s great that people are thinking more consciously about their lifestyle habits, often, their motivations are rooted in aesthetics rather than overall health. Even with inclusive campaigns like the body positivity movement, body image still controls so many people, especially women, and thus, any new behaviors are merely temporary. I want to see if AI can help me uncover the secrets to establishing healthy habits, so that lifestyle changes can be maintained long-term. I’d also like to understand the role of mental health in these processes.\nClaude AI identified the following factors as drivers of the shift:\n\nSocial Media Algorithms Increased promotion of “girl routines” and “what I eat in a day” content\nVisibility of GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy)\nEconomic anxiety During times of uncertainty, people over-fixate on things they can control, like their bodies\nBacklash Fatigue body positivity themes became corporatized and seemingly performative\nGen Z entering their 20s\nWellness-to-ED Pipeline\n\nI then prompted AI to consider demographics as contributors to these trends,!\n\nSince more people are beginning to gravitate towards AI as their first source for quick questions about losing weight and changing their diets, how can AI intervene to push healthier habits?\n\nPersonalized health tracking (non-aesthetic)\n\n\nAI can monitor biomarkers, sleep quality, energy levels, strength gains, mental health indicators\nShift metrics from “pounds lost” to “improved HRV” or “better sleep scores”\nProblem: Most apps still center weight/appearance\n\n\nConversational AI coaching\n\n\nChatbots that challenge distorted thinking patterns (like CBT for EDs)\nCatch diet culture language and reframe it (“I need to be skinny” → - “What’s the actual concern here?”)\nProvide real-time intervention when users express disordered thoughts\n\n\nContent moderation & feed curation\n\n\nAI can identify and limit thinspo/fitspo content\nDeprioritize before/after photos, body checking content\nBoost educational health content over transformation content\nCurrently underused - platforms profit from engagement\n\n\nImage recognition for trigger warnings\n\n\nFlag potentially triggering content (extreme thinness, body checks)\nAllow users to filter their feeds proactively\nSome tools exist but aren’t mainstream\n\n\nPersonalized education\n\n\nAI tutors that teach HAES (Health At Every Size) principles\nExplain why BMI is flawed, how metabolic health ≠ size\nAdapt to user’s specific misconceptions\n\n\nPattern recognition in user behavior\n\n\nDetect early warning signs of disordered eating (obsessive logging, restriction patterns)\nGentle interventions before behaviors escalate\nConnect users to resources\n\nFinally, I was curious about the role that mental health has played in the cyclical nature of diet culture: 1. Emotional regulation - Without addressing the root emotion, any habit change feels like deprivation and fails. 2. Stress response - Chronic stress elevates cortisol, disrupts sleep, and kills motivation. 3. Self-worth baseline - If you hate yourself, “healthy habits” become punishment, which isn’t sustainable. Self-compassion predicts long-term success. 4. Executive function - Depression and ADHD impair planning, consistency, and follow-through. 5. All-or-nothing thinking - Anxiety breeds perfectionism. Mental flexibility is crucial."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the dating circuit, whether you’re talking in person, through Tinder, or miming through a window, the conversation almost always turns to the question: “What’s your love language?” People then decide whether their favorite way to give or receive love is through words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, gift-giving, or acts of service. As of now, the answer to this question serves primarily as a fun fact or a guide to one’s partner for how to show interest, but I’m curious to know whether people’s love languages indicate combatibility. Are two people with the same love language most compatible or is there a combination of different languages that make a relationship more likely to succeed long-term? Let’s see what AI has to say!\nwhat are the pros and cons of love languages\nWhat’s good about love languages: * Improves communication: It helps people articulate their needs and understand their partner’s.\n\nReduces misunderstandings: Sometimes partners show love differently, so recognizing differing styles can ease friction.\nPromotes empathy: It shifts the focus from how you want to give love to how the other person receives it.\n\nThe caveats:\n\nIt’s not scientific: While based on observation, love languages haven’t been rigorously supported by psychological research. They’re more of a tool than a truth.\nPeople are dynamic: Your love language can change over time, or vary by context (e.g., romantic vs. platonic relationships).\nRelationships need more: Love languages aren’t a fix-all. They don’t replace boundaries, trust, or emotional maturity.\nIt seems AI thinks of love languages as a solid starting point for understanding a partner, but warns that they can be used as a crutch when trying to understand conflicts in a relationship.\n\n\nare there any love language combinations that are more compatible than others?\n\nQuality Time + Quality Time\n  Why it works: Both partners feel loved through shared presence and undivided attention.\nNatural synergy: They’re likely to spend meaningful time together, communicate well, and build emotional intimacy just by being with each other.\nActs of Service + Acts of Service\nWhy it works: Both express love by doing — helping, fixing, showing up.\nNatural synergy: They tend to notice and appreciate effort-based gestures. There’s a mutual understanding that love is action, not just words.\nWords of Affirmation + Physical Touch\n  Why it works: These two are highly expressive — one verbally, the other physically — and often reinforce each other.\n\nwhich combinations are the least compatible?\n\nWords of Affirmation + Acts of Service\n  Why it’s tough: One person is waiting to hear love, while the other thinks they’ve already shown it.\nCommon problem: “Why do I need to say it if I do it?” vs. “Why do you do things for me but never tell me how you feel?”\nReceiving Gifts + Physical Touch\n  Why it’s tough: One thrives on symbolic tokens, the other on presence and contact.\nDisconnect risk: The gift-oriented partner might feel shallow to the touch-oriented one, and vice versa — unless they learn to value each other’s gestures.\nQuality Time + Acts of Service\n  Why it’s tough: One partner might be busy doing things for the other (cleaning, errands), but not spending time with them — which leads to feeling unappreciated.\nMismatch dynamic: “I did all this for you!” vs. “I just wanted you to sit with me.”\n\nThere’s emphasis on the fact that a mismatched pair of love languages is not doomed; they require more conscious effort to succeed.\n\nWhen approaching reationships, I consider love languages as an interesting quality and something to consider when thinking about how to show care towards a person, and I was surprised to learned from AI that many people use it as a crucial factor for determining compatibility. While having the same love language would certainly be helpful, there are other factors such as emotional availability and long-term goals, that are vital to developing a healthy, sustainable relationship."

    "text": "General Thoughts\nI’m about halfway through Joy Buolamwini’s “Unmasking AI,” and things are starting to intensify. What’s sticking with me from this section is how she breaks down the actual mechanics of how AI systems fail, and the fact that she’s doing it in a way that makes the details fascinating to non-technical readers.\nOne thing that stuck out to me was how she explained the whole training data problem. Basically, if you’re building a facial recognition system and you only feed it one phenotype, it’s going to be really good at recognizing people with those features and woefully unsuccessful with everyone else. She shows how this isn’t just a small glitch, but the problem is baked into how these systems are designed.\nShe also gets into the corporate side, discussing how companies rush these products to market without adequate testing across different demographics, producing consequences for users: misidentifications, false arrests, and people being locked out of services they need. The stakes are incredibly high, especially for minority communities that are already over-policed. Overall, this section really solidified the importance of this work.\n\n\nQuestions and Reflections:\n\nHow does she characterize the responsibility of tech companies for systematic failures?\n\nShe’s critical of how tech companies prioritize speed and profit over thorough testing. She calls for these institutions to consider who might be harmed by their systems before rushing them to market.\n\nWhat patterns am I noticing in how AI failures manifest?\n\nThere’s a clear pattern: the people who build AI systems often don’t represent the diversity of people who will be affected by them. This leads to blind spots that become embedded in the technology itself. The failures aren’t random—they consistently harm the same groups of people.\nThe book is building a compelling case that AI bias isn’t a technical problem with a purely technical solution. It’s a social justice issue that requires us to fundamentally rethink how we approach these technologies."

Though I didn’t love hearing about murderous psychopaths while sitting in the woods or in a dark basement, I have fond memories of cuddling with my friends and eating snacks while we all pretended not to be on the verge of tears. With the evolution of technology and social media, younger generations are slowly forgetting the art of telling scary stories. They may be tired of the classics with predictable endings, so I’d like to try mixing it up. Let’s see if AI can help me write a story that strays away from typical tropes and is scary enough to make a grown man cry!!\nThe LLM and I took turns contributing to the story, each writing one sentence at a time. Here’s our final story!\n“The neighbor’s security camera footage showed me arriving home at 6:47 PM, but I distinctly remember sitting in traffic until at least 7:30. I thought it was simply a misunderstanding, but when the figure turned to the camera, I saw my face. The timestamp burned in the corner—6:47 PM—and I watched myself unlock my front door with the same nervous habit of jiggling the key twice, something I’d never told anyone about. As the door opened, I saw my dog run towards the figure before sniffing and slowly backing away. The figure crouched down and extended my hand toward him in exactly the way I always did, but Rex’s ears flattened against his skull, and a low whine escaped his throat that I’d never heard in eight years of owning him. The figure bent down and its body covered Rex from the camera. When it stood back up thirty seconds later, Rex was gone—no sound of claws on hardwood, no barking, just the figure wiping its hands on my jeans the way I do after petting him. Suddenly I heard my baby cry. The figure’s head snapped toward the stairs with an unnatural speed, and then it smiled at the camera—my smile, but too wide, holding it for far too long as the crying upstairs grew more frantic. As I watched the camera, I began to cry, fearful to see what may have happened next. The footage continued—the figure climbing my stairs with footsteps that were somehow too light, too measured—and then my phone buzzed with a text from my own number:”Don’t come home.” I immediately dashed home, but once I’d gotten there, I wished I’d listened to the message. The front door was already open, swinging gently in the wind, and from inside I could hear my own voice singing the lullaby I always sang to Emma—but there were two voices, harmonizing. I noticed that my husband’s shoes were at the door, but he was supposed to be at a conference. I stepped inside and the singing stopped immediately, replaced by the sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor upstairs, and then my husband’s voice called down cheerfully, “Honey, you’re home early—we were just playing a game.” I looked in his arms, seeing a shape that mirrored the baby’s. As my eyes adjusted to the dim hallway light, I realized the bundle in his arms was moving wrong—the joints bending in places they shouldn’t, like it was being puppeteered from the inside. Frozen in place, I rattled my brain thinking of what might be happening, then it clicked. The conference wasn’t until next week—I’d written it on the calendar myself—which meant my husband should have been at work, and whatever was holding that thing at the top of the stairs had been waiting here since 6:47 PM for the real me to come home. Behind me, I heard my own voice whisper, “We’ve been waiting for you,” and when I spun around, I was staring at myself, still wearing the clothes I’d put on that morning, and in the reflection of her eyes I could see my husband standing at the top of the stairs—holding me.”\nLet’s see why AI thinks the story was successful without having to follow typical tropes:\nPrompt:\nWhat do you think made this story work\nResponse:\n\nThe uncanny valley of “self”\nGrounded, specific details\nEscalating stakes organically\nAmbiguity about what’s happening\nThe animals know\nThat final reversal\nCollaborative building\n\n\nWhat do you think? Did our story fill you with fear?"

Its popularity has enabled thousands of people to build their own brands by sharing their go-to products and doing brand reviews with company sponsorships. We constantly see public figures deploying new skincare lines, despite there already being a multitude of functional products on the market, yet their products still sell due to their status. I’m curious about how people choose to craft their skincare routines: do they value consistency and predictability, or novelty? I prompted AI to decide what factors most people tend to consider when developing their skin routine, how those considerations change based on age group, and provide a recommendation for my skincare routine based on the products I’m currently using.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: In two sentences, how do you think social media has influenced people’s skincare practices\nCopilot: Social media has amplified skincare trends and product recommendations, often driven by influencers and viral content, making routines more accessible but also more commercialized. It’s also fostered greater awareness of ingredients and skin conditions, encouraging people to research and personalize their skincare choices.\nMe: when consumers are choosing products what do you think they pay attention to the most:consistency and predictability, or novelty\nCopilot: It depends on the context—consumers tend to value consistency and predictability when it comes to essentials like skincare, food, or household items, where reliability and trust matter most. But when shopping for fashion, tech, or entertainment, novelty often wins, driven by curiosity, trends, and the desire for something fresh or exciting.\nI then prompted copilot to provide an estimate of how much weight each characteristic carries when consumers are purchasing skincare products. AI responded with the following chart:\n\nOut of curiosity, I wanted to see what products AI would recommend for my routine based on current trends and the following supplemental information:\n\nAI recognizes social media’s influence on how people perceive skincare and even acknowledges the risk of being misled due to the commercialization of sponsored products. Though audiences require greater awareness of potential false advertisements, social media has enabled the public to grow more aware of what they’re putting on their skin while also fostering a sense of unity/community amongst those who have become insecure due to their skin. The majority of people self-treat skin-related issues rather than seeking professional help, and when deciding what to use, AI finds that though the majority of the population values consistency & predictability, Gen Z finds novelty and innovation slightly more favorable. AI was also able to provide me with a custom skincare routine to address some of my problem areas, and like the rest of my generation, I might take its advice."

    "text": "I remember when growing up, I wanted to be on TV like all of my favorite stars from Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. I saw being on this network as my launching point and confidently believed that I would grow up to be a world-renowned movie star like Taraji P. Henson or Regina Hall. I no longer want to be a famous Hollywood actor, but I still occasionally find myself looking into the child stars I used to love watching, and am surprised to see that, despite their efforts, many have failed to break into the industry and establish themselves as serious actors. I’ve seen the term “Disney Kid Curse” be used to address this phenomenon; those who’ve been prominent features on the channel struggle to secure mature roles because the public still sees them as the little kids they were introduced as. I want to see if AI can break down this phenomenon further and explore potential strategic choices that would maximize former Disney kids’ chance at achieving longevity as actors in the industry.\nWhen I first asked AI about it understanding of the “Disney Kid Curse”, it focused on the long-term personal issues that some child stars, like Lindsey Lohan, Demi Lovato, and Miley Cyrus, have experienced after becoming adults.\nOnce I clarified, AI revealed that child stars struggle to land more mature roles due to the following:\n\nAudience rejection - fans struggle to accept them outside their Disney persona\nIndustry skepticism - casting directors won’t consider them for serious dramatic roles\nBox office struggles - their post-Disney films often underperform\n\nThe audience rejection facet was not surprising to me. In my personal experience on social media, I have often come across child stars’ profiles. When they try posting amateur content, comments often refer to them by the name of their character or post popular memes from when they were younger.\nI wanted to dive deeper into which of these factors holds the most weight in their downward career trajectories, so I asked AI, “how do hollywood casting execs deal with a disney kid: do these actors struggle because they attempt to breakout and are rejcted, or do casting agents not even give them the chance?\nIt’s both, but primarily the latter - casting directors often don’t even give them a chance. The problem happens at the audition/consideration stage:\n\nThey’re not called in - For serious dramatic roles, casting directors filter Disney Kids out before they can prove themselves.\nPreemptive typecasting - Execs assume audiences won’t buy them in mature roles, so they don’t waste time auditioning them. It’s a business calculation about box office viability.\nAge demographic mismatch - Their fanbase skews young, but adult prestige films need audiences who… don’t associate them with tween sitcoms.\n\nWhen they do get auditions, it’s considered an uphill battle to not only land the role, but to prove to audiences that they have range.\nI then prompted AI with a hypothetical: “Pretend I’m Skai Jackson, who starred in the series, ‘Jessie’, and it is 2015 and the show has just ended. Make me a career plan to establish myself as a mature actress who could ideally reach Zendaya-level stardom.”\nPHASE 1: 2015-2017 - Strategic Distance & Credibility Building Immediate (2015-2016):\nTake a break. No new Disney projects. Let the “Jessie” association cool. Hire new representation - Get an agent known for career transformations (CAA/UTA), not Disney-pipeline agents Social media rebrand - Shift from bubbly kid content to thoughtful, socially conscious voice. Show maturity and substance. Target: One prestige indie film - Take a supporting role in a Sundance-type drama. Low pay, high credibility. Think something like The Hate U Give (if you can get in early) or similar coming-of-age with social weight.\n2017:\nGuest arc on prestige TV - Land a 3-4 episode arc on a critically acclaimed HBO/FX/Netflix drama. Not a lead, but a role that shows range. Think Euphoria-type content before Euphoria existed.\nPHASE 2: 2018-2020 - Prove Your Range 2018-2019:\nLead in festival indie film - Take the lead in a gritty independent film that premieres at Sundance/Toronto. Something that shows dramatic chops - abuse survivor, activist, complex teen navigating trauma. Awards campaign hustle - Do the festival circuit, press, interviews showing your intelligence and depth Voice work in animated prestige - Something like Spider-Verse - keeps you working, different audience\n2020:\nSupporting role in studio film - Not the lead yet, but a memorable supporting role in a film with A-list actors. Learn from them, get associated with quality.\nPHASE 3: 2021-2023 - The Breakout 2021:\nLead in streaming prestige limited series - This is your Euphoria moment. Netflix/HBO limited series (6-8 episodes) where you play a complex, flawed character. Drug addiction, sexuality, moral ambiguity - show you can handle adult themes.\n2022-2023:\nStudio lead with respected director - You’ve proven yourself. Now take the lead in a mid-budget ($30-50M) studio film with a respected director. Jordan Peele-type, Barry Jenkins, Greta Gerwig - someone whose name carries weight. Awards consideration - This role should get you nominated (Golden Globe, SAG, maybe Oscar)\nPHASE 4: 2024-2025 - Zendaya Territory 2024:\nFranchise/tentpole - Now you can do blockbuster without being labeled “just Disney.” Marvel, DC, or prestige sci-fi like Dune. Fashion deals & brand partnerships - Now that you’re credible, luxury brands will come calling\n2025:\nProducer credit - Start producing projects that interest you. Creative control = longevity\nI wonder if this plan would prove successful if the next generation of Disney Kids were to follow it!"

    "text": "The months of August and September featured extensive online discourse about the promotional ad by GAP starring Katseye and the ad by American Eagle starring Sydney Sweeney. Many critiqued American Eagle’s ad being an homage to the distasteful Calvin Klein ad that starred an underage Brooke Shields in 1980. In addition to backlash for remaking an ad already deemed inappropriate, American Eagle was also condemned for using language that seemingly idealizes genetics like Sydney Sweeney’s and promotes white supremacist narratives. GAP, oppositionally cast a Global girl group that featured members from diverse backgrounds and delivered a message of fun, versatility, and acceptance. After using AI to see the performance statistics of these ads across platforms, I plan to see if AI can break down audience response to the two ads by different demographics, including age, racial group, and region. Finally, I want to see AI’s opinion of the two ads.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: in 3 sentences, what is your main takeaway from public discourse about Gap’s and American Eagle’s most recent jeans ads\nCopilot: Public discourse around Gap and American Eagle’s 2025 jeans ads highlights a stark contrast in strategy: Gap’s “Better in Denim” campaign was praised for its inclusive, dance-driven celebration featuring global girl group KATSEYE2. Meanwhile, American Eagle’s ad with Sydney Sweeney sparked controversy over its “good genes” pun, drawing criticism for tone-deaf messaging and perceived eugenics undertones3. The conversation underscores how authenticity and cultural sensitivity can drive positive engagement, while provocative tactics risk backlash—even if they generate buzz.\nMe: what are the total performance metrics (likes, shares, clicks to website) of each ad across platforms\nCopilot provided the following\n\nGap’s campaign leaned into cultural resonance and inclusivity, while American Eagle’s shock-value strategy drove massive reach and customer acquisition. If you’d like, I can help visualize this comparison or track future updates.\nI then prompted it to rate audience approval across different demographics.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot successfully presented me with metrics showing the cumulative success of each ad and communicated the general reactions of audience members from various demographics. These breakdowns showed the GAP ad to be unanimously preferred to American Eagle’s. Most of the social discourse I’d seen criticized the discriminatory undertones of the American Eagle ad, so I wasn’t surprised to see this reflected in the ratings. I agree with AI’s conclusion that GAP’s inclusive casting and modernization of an old song made it resonate with such a broad audience and was the key to their success. If other brands want to see similar trends, they would benefit from following Gap’s example; however, I wonder if audiences would perceive it as a shift towards a more inclusive culture or an inauthentic, desperate cash-grab attempt."

    "text": "Current Thoughts:\nSo I’ve been making my way through Unmasking AI by Joy Buolamwini, and I just hit around page 150. What’s really sticking with me from this section is how she breaks down the actual mechanics of how AI systems fail. But she doesn’t do it in a boring, textbook way. Instead, she uses these really concrete examples that make you go “oh wow, that’s actually terrifying.”\nOne thing that jumped out at me is how she explains the whole training data problem. Basically, if you’re building a facial recognition system and you only feed it photos of white men, it’s going to be really good at recognizing white men and absolutely terrible at recognizing everyone else. She shows how this isn’t just a small glitch, but it’s baked into how these systems are designed from the ground up.\nWhat I appreciate is that she doesn’t just point fingers; she actually walks through how she discovered these failures in her own research. At one point, she’s testing facial recognition software on herself, and the system straight-up doesn’t detect her face until she puts on a white mask. That’s the algorithm literally not seeing her as human until she makes herself look white. It’s such a powerful image, and it really drives home how these supposedly “objective” systems are anything but.\nShe also gets into the corporate side, discussing how companies rush these products to market without adequate testing across different demographics. The consequences are real: misidentifications, false arrests, and people being locked out of services they need. The stakes are incredibly high, especially for communities that are already over-policed and underserved. Overall, this section really solidified for me why this work matters. It’s not just about making better algorithms; it’s about questioning who builds them, how they’re tested, and who pays the price when they fail.\nQuestions and Reflections\n\nWhat specific technical concepts does the author explain, and how accessible are these explanations?\n\nShe breaks down concepts like training data bias and accuracy rates across demographics. The explanations are really accessible because she uses real-world examples instead of heavy jargon. Even without a computer science background, you can follow along.\n\nHow does the author connect technical failures to broader social issues?\n\nShe consistently links algorithmic failures back to systemic racism and sexism. When facial recognition fails on darker-skinned faces, she connects it to historical patterns of who gets seen and valued in society.\n\nWhat examples of algorithmic harm does she provide?\n\nShe talks about facial recognition misidentifying people, which can lead to wrongful arrests. She also discusses how these systems are deployed in ways that disproportionately affect marginalized communities—especially in policing contexts.\n\nDoes the author discuss the role of tech companies\n\nHow does she characterize their responsibility? Yes, she’s critical of how tech companies prioritize speed and profit over thorough testing. She calls for these institutions to consider who might be harmed by their systems before rushing them to market.\n\nI’m excited to finish the book and see what other criticisms of AI Buolamwini discusses!"

    "text": "The beauty standards for women have always been fickle in the United States. Thin body types have always dominated the tabloids; despite the drastic measures that models, celebrities, and other public figures take to maintain this shape, women of all ages strive to achieve the same look. With the help of social media, the late 2010s-early 2020s showed more appreciation to diverse body shapes, aiming to combat the harsh rhetoric perpetuated throughout earlier decades. This era of of “body positivity” helped many women to mend their relationships with food and love their bodies. Brands like Victoria’s Secret were condemned for upholding near impossible expectations, and due to the pressures of female audiences began to introduce different body shapes into their catologues, websites, and most notable their annual fashion show. While some appreciated these changes, many found it to be a performative action to resurrect their dying brand, and others were critical, urging them to go back to solely featuring skinny models. Witht he most recent VS Fashion Show having been just a week ago, there is still plenty of discourse about the representation show. Having strayed from their original “brand”, I’m curious to know how AI would claddify VS’ new position. Can AI generate the “ideal VS Angel” for each of these decades? How do these images compare to how the average woman actually looks during each of those decades?\nprompt how would you summarize the body standards for women across the past 4 decades (90s-present)\nresponse 1990s: “Heroin Chic” & Ultra-Thin Ideal: Extremely thin, waif-like figures with minimal curves. Influences: Supermodels like Kate Moss; grunge fashion; rise of minimalism. Features: Pale skin, visible bones, flat stomachs, and androgynous silhouettes. Cultural tone: Rebellion against the glam of the 80s; edgy, raw, and anti-establishment.\n💪 2000s: Athletic & Low-Rise Obsession Ideal: Slim but toned bodies with flat abs and visible muscle definition. Influences: Pop stars like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera; rise of reality TV. Features: Low-rise jeans emphasized hip bones; emphasis on youth and sexual appeal. Cultural tone: Hyper-focus on diet culture, tabloid scrutiny, and celebrity workout routines.\n🍑 2010s: Curvy & “Instagram-Ready” Ideal: Hourglass figures with large busts, tiny waists, and prominent hips and buttocks. Influences: Kim Kardashian, Nicki Minaj, and social media filters. Features: Enhanced curves (often surgically or digitally); contoured makeup and waist trainers. Cultural tone: Rise of influencer culture, body modification, and curated online personas.\n🌈 2020s: Body Positivity & Diverse Beauty Ideal: More inclusive and varied—celebrating different shapes, sizes, and ethnic features. Influences: Activists, plus-size models, Gen Z aesthetics, and mental health awareness. Features: Acceptance of natural bodies, stretch marks, cellulite, and gender-fluid expression. Cultural tone: Pushback against unrealistic standards; emphasis on authenticity, self-love, and representation\nprompt briefly describe victoria secret’s influence on these standards each decades\nresponse Victoria’s Secret played a major role in shaping and amplifying mainstream beauty ideals from the 1990s through the 2010s, with its influence evolving alongside cultural shifts:\n👙 1990s: The Rise of the “Angel” Impact: Victoria’s Secret popularized the ultra-thin, tall, leggy supermodel as the pinnacle of femininity. Aesthetic: Glamorous yet unattainable—emphasizing flat stomachs, long limbs, and minimal body fat.\n💫 2000s: Bombshell Era Impact: The brand leaned into hyper-feminine, overtly sexualized imagery with push-up bras and glossy runway shows. Aesthetic: Slim but curvy—flat abs with enhanced cleavage and toned legs.\n💥 2010s: Peak Fantasy & Backlash Impact: The annual Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show became a global spectacle, but criticism grew over lack of diversity and unrealistic standards. Aesthetic: Hourglass figures with exaggerated proportions, often enhanced by lighting, editing, and cosmetic procedures.\n🌱 2020s: Collapse & Reinvention Impact: Facing declining sales and cultural criticism, Victoria’s Secret canceled its fashion show and began rebranding with more inclusive models and messaging. New direction: Featuring athletes, activists, and plus-size models like Paloma Elsesser and Megan Rapinoe. Cultural effect: Acknowledged its role in promoting narrow beauty ideals and is now attempting to align with body positivity and modern feminism.\nprompt create a chart, and on a scale of 1-10, rate how well the representation of women in vs catalogues, clothing sizes, and fashion shows aligned with the beauty standard of that decade\n\nVictoria’s Secret is notorious for perpetuating beauty standards that are near impossible for the average woman to attain, so I wanted to see how the gap in their alignment with realistic female features has changed across those decades.\nI attempted to have AI generate an image of a typical VS model next to the idealized body type of that decade and received the following response:\n\nprompt: generate an image that shows a victoria secret model in a fashion show during the 90s, and on the other side, show the average woman (in terms of body size in the us) during the 90s\nWhen I made the same request for the 00s, 2010s, and 2020s… the LLM responded with the following:\nresponse: I can’t generate that image. It was blocked because it involves potentially sensitive content—likely due to comparing body types in a way that could reinforce stereotypes or unrealistic standards.\nIf you’re exploring how beauty ideals have evolved or want to visualize aspirational health and confidence in a more inclusive way, I’d be happy to help reframe the concept. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!\nPerhaps it’s because, as time has gone on, society has grown to be more accepting of body types that lie outside of the 1990s standards. I would be curious to see side-by-side igenerated images depicting the “idealized body types” of each decade."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Have you met Hollywood’s newest upcoming sensation? She’s supposedly a star in the making and expected to be a diverse actress capable of portraying a variety of roles, but the craziest part…SHE’S NOT REAL! That’s right, Hollywood has just announced the debut of the first-ever AI actress, whom they’ve named Tilly Norwood. This new revelation is sparking tons of opposing opinions: some are excited about this new capability and look forward to seeing how AI will interact with live actors and whether this new venture will be successful. On the other hand, many are worried about how this young “actress” will be portrayed. Hollywood already faces backlash for misogynistic storylines that are portrayed by actors, and it is often the actresses themselves who, in their refusal to act out certain behaviors, stop things from going too far. Studios can have Tilly do and say whatever they want. Many believe that this makes a mockery of women’s autonomy and fear that it will set back progress that’s been made in the fight for respectful treatment towards women in Hollywood. So, what do you think? Is this a great new capability, or have things been taken too far? I wonder what AI LLM’s have to say about this!\nWhat are 3 pros and 3 cons to introducing AI actress, Tilly Norwood, into Hollywood?\nPROS 1. Creative Innovation & New Storytelling Tool - Supporters view AI as a new creative tool comparable to animation, puppetry, or CGI that opens fresh possibilities for storytelling without replacing human actors. 2. Artistic Expression - Defenders frame Tilly as a piece of art rather than a replacement, arguing that she sparks important conversations about creativity. 3. Technical Advancement - The creator describes her as representing new possibilities in filmmaking technology, similar to how previous innovations expanded creative options.\nCONS 1. Job Displacement & Threat to Human Actors - SAG-AFTRA and many actors view this as devaluing human artistry, with the union explicitly stating “Tilly Norwood is not an actor” and expressing concern about synthetic performers being used without proper contractual protections. 2. Ethical Issues with Training Data - Critics point out that hundreds of living young women’s faces were composited together to create Tilly, questioning why those real actors couldn’t have been hired instead. 3. Gendered Control Concerns - Many critics noted it’s “not surprising the first major ‘AI actor’ is a young woman they can fully control,” highlighting concerns about creating a controllable female performer.\n“Do you think Tilly’s interaction on screen with human actors will be successful to the point where she and potential other AI actors will pose a genuine threat to working actors?”\nTechnical Issues - Spontaneous reactions to scene partners - Physical presence and spatial awareness on set - Real-time collaboration with directors making adjustments - Genuine chemistry and emotional responsiveness - Improvisation and adaptation\nThe Real Concern 1. Background and minor roles - Where the performance demands are lower and cost savings are significant 2. Commercial and corporate content - Where “good enough” is acceptable 3. Contractual erosion - Studios using AI to avoid paying residuals, royalties, or fair wages 4. Bargaining power - Even if AI isn’t technically superior, the threat of replacement weakens actors’ negotiating positions\n“Will this new capability, pose equal threat to newcomers in the industry and pre-established actors?”\nEmerging/Green Actors are most vulnerable because…\n\nEntry-level roles that could vanish entirely\nThe “ladder” of incremental opportunities\nVisibility and networking\nBuilding a reel\n\nEstablished/Prominent Actors are better protected because of… - Name recognition = box office value - Studios need stars people actually want to see - Bargaining power - Strong agents, contracts, unions protecting their likeness rights - Unique artistic value - Their specific persona, reputation, and proven audience draw - Financial cushion - Can afford to be selective and weather industry changes\nBut what happens to those who fall between A-List and unknown? If AI hinders newbies from entering on the ground floor, how will we create new stars to be on top?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Animation styles have evolved over the years as new technological capabilities have allowed them to do so. Innovation has enabled companies to transition from black-and-white to colored content, from 2D to 3D styles, and more. These new possibilities invite more diverse designs; however, there is often pushback against changed styles for franchises that remain active for extended periods. For example, the Shrek movies have been enjoyed by viewers across generations; however, the trailers for the most recent film revealed drastic changes in animation, which fueled critiques from fans of the classics. Is nostalgia stopping viewers from embracing new styles, or are certain types of animation inherently more appealing to viewers regardless of previous exposure to similar content? Let’s see what AI thinks about competing ideas in animation.\nAI has recognized significant changes in animation styles over the past four decades, identifying components such as line work, color vibrancy, and character expressionism as distinguishing details. While 90’s animations are recognized for “squiggly lines and expressive character designs” made famous by groups like Klasky-Csupo, this decade’s animations are praised for “highly polished animation with dynamic lighting and detailed backgrounds.”\n\n\nThis evolution of styles diversifies content, but how do different generations feel about new animation features?\n\nDespite each generation’s preferences, the general consensus about the shift from 90s techniques to modern animation is the following…\n\nUltimately, I sought to determine if AI could generate images that mimicked the animation styles of these two decades. Can you guess which image represents each decade?"

    "text": "General Thoughts\nI’ve finished Joy Buolamwini’s “Unmasking AI,” and she did a great job of using the final sections to shift from diagnosis to action; here’s where she really shows her vision for what needs to change.\nI really appreciated her emphasis on accountability. She discusses the need for transparency in AI systems, arguing that people have a right to know when algorithms are making decisions about their lives. She also advocates for regulatory frameworks that would hold tech companies responsible for the harms their systems cause. The point isn’t to stifle innovation, but ensure that vulnerable companies aren’t paying the price for it.\nI was inspired by her discussion of the Algorithmic Justice League. She founded this group to fight for equitable and accountable AI, and she frames this work as part of a larger movement for civil rights in the digital age. Just as previous generations fought for equal treatment under the law, we now need to fight for equal treatment by algorithms, especially seeing how they’re increasingly governing our lives.\nThe book ends on a note that’s both cautionary and hopeful. She paints an optimistic picture of what inclusive AI could look like. She recognizes the scale of the challenges ahead, but also believes change is possible if we collectively demand it. Reading this book has fundamentally shifted how I think about AI. It’s not a neutral tool; it reflects our society’s values and biases, and as a collective, we have a responsibility to do better.\n\n\nQuestions and Reflections:\n\nWhat questions remain?\n\nI’m curious about what resistance from the tech industry would look like. How would companies respond to calls for greater accountability? I’d also like to know more about successful examples of algorithmic justice work!\n\nWhat will I take away from this book moving forward?\n\nI’ll approach AI systems with much more skepticism, especially when they’re deployed in high-stakes contexts like criminal justice or hiring.\nThis book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how AI is reshaping our world and who wants to ensure that transformation doesn’t replicate the inequalities of the past."

Highly sought-after positions are getting harder and harder to secure due to the mass number of applicants and the “game” that comes with applying. To get your foot in the door, you must do more than submit a resume; you have to attend networking events, do coffee chats, and send cold emails. It’s easy to fill out tens of applications, but the worst part of applying is writing the dreaded cover letter. Almost every job recruiting new grads expects a 2-400 letter essentially praising the company and explaining why you are a perfect match, but when everyone knows the recipe, how do you stand out? I’m going to write a letter for a current job posting using AI, each of us contributing 3 words at a time. I’ll compare the final product to a cover letter I have written myself for that same job and have AI decide which one would be most likely to move on to the interview round!\nBefore starting the writing process, I uploaded my resume so that the LLM can reference specific experiences and qualifications. Here’s the final result!\nDear L’Oréal Hiring Team, I’m excited to apply for the Marketing position and express my passion for beauty, wellness, and catering to diverse consumer needs. My prior experiences at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson have equipped me with skills crucial to driving brand growth through data analysis and strategic marketing initiatives. I align with L’Oréal’s commitment to innovation and consumer-focused initiatives that create meaningful impact and promote inclusivity across diverse cultural segments. I’m eager to leverage my cross-functional collaboration so that I can develop comprehensive marketing strategies that’ll inform product launches and optimize product performance long-term. My leadership roles in Strictly Funk Dance Company and Black Wharton Consulting have equipped me with P&L management experiences that have strengthened my ability to optimize spending for maximum profitability while maintaining focus on crucial brand objectives. I successfully prioritized spending areas and reduced operational costs, making this year’s budget more efficient. My skills and acumen position me to excel as a leader in L’Oréal’s dynamic environment. I hope to contribute innovative solutions and learn from adept professionals shaping beauty’s future. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Aitalia Sharpe\nI used another LLM to rate this cover letter compared to the letter I wrote myself. I’ll definitely continue writing them myself going forward."

    "text": "I grew up watching reality shows like Dance Moms and Bring It! Both shows focus on a group of about 7 young girls who travel and dance competitively every week. While viewers get to watch the girls compete and grow in their craft, a large portion of each episode revolves around the drama between their competitive moms, all of whom desire that their child be the star of their studio. I enjoyed watching the drama when I was younger to the point where I would pick my favorite dancer and mom and pick sides during their arguments. However, rewatching these shows at an older age, I realize the potential damage done to each child’s psychological health as a result of growing up in such hectic, hostile environments. The general public tends to argue that, though both shows put the girls in stressful situations due to all of the travel and new choreography that they have to juggle on top of school, the girls featured on Dance Moms had worse experiences than those on Bring It! I wanted to see if AI would be able to form an opinion on the environments of each show and conclude whether or not reality TV in general could be considered a safe environment for children.\n\n\n\nChat GPT was able to identify differences in the structure of each show, causing one to have produce more harmful outcomes for the young cast members. For bith shows, the competitive stress that caused the children to value perfection over performance and over-bearing schedule of being featured on reality tv were primary stressors for the children on both shows. However, AI identified the coaching styles as a distinguishing factor. The coach of dance moms placed intense pressure on the girls and promoted internal competition between teammates that viewers joined in on, leading dancers less favored to be heavily scrutinized by the public. The coach of Bring it, on the other hand, promoted community through mentorship. By not dividing the team, her leadership style enticed the viewing audience to root for the team as a whole. Bring It was decided ot be an overall healthier environment compared to Dance Moms because it fostered growth rather than stifling emotional development. When asked to generalize, AI concluded that reality tv is not a safe environment for children because of the immense pressure and lack of protection against public scrutiny."

    "text": "The majority of Americans are unaware of how to manage their money when they enter early adulthood. Without conducting their own research, young adults are left oblivious to credit, financial management, investing, and building a sustainable net worth. Education is mandated for all US children until the completion of 12th grade, and despite offering electives in different educational areas, few schools offer students the opportunity to learn about money. Should courses on financial literacy be a required offering at all secondary and higher education schools? Should it become a mandated component of the standard curriculum? If so, at which point in a student’s education should such content be introduced, and should it replace other sub-topics that are taught universally? How can AI help us to better integrate financial literacy courses into schools?\nPrompt: should financial literacy become a core part of school curriculum\nResponse:\nPros: - Many adults struggle with basic financial decisions (debt, interest rates, retirement savings), leading to real hardship that early education could prevent Creates equity—wealthier families teach money management at home, while others lack access to this knowledge - Practical life skill with tangible, long-term benefits\nCons: - Schools already overcrowded with “essential” topics—something else would need to be cut or school hours extended - Research shows standalone financial literacy courses often have limited long-term impact—students forget or struggle to apply lessons years later - Financial decisions are often more about behavior and circumstances than knowledge\nMiddle ground: - Integrate financial concepts into existing subjects (compound interest in math, economic policy in history, advertising analysis in English) - Offer as an elective rather than required course, with resources available when students need them\n\nHow would the financial health of america’s population change, if academic interventions for financial literacy were made\n\nWhat studies actually show:\n\nMost rigorous evaluations find that school-based financial literacy programs produce small improvements in financial knowledge, but these gains often fade over time The impact on actual financial behaviors (saving rates, debt levels, credit scores) is typically modest at best—many studies find no significant long-term effects A major meta-analysis found that financial education explains only about 0.1% of variance in financial behaviors—far less than factors like income, employment stability, or family background\n\nWhy interventions underperform expectations:\n\nTiming problem: Teaching 16-year-olds about mortgages or retirement accounts doesn’t stick when they won’t need that information for years or decades Knowledge-behavior gap: Understanding compound interest doesn’t automatically translate to consistent saving, especially when facing immediate financial pressures Structural barriers: Financial literacy can’t overcome low wages, high cost of living, medical debt, or lack of access to affordable banking services\nRealistic impact if widely implemented: America’s population would likely see marginal improvements—perhaps slightly fewer predatory loan victims, modestly better credit scores among some groups, incrementally higher emergency savings. But we wouldn’t see dramatic shifts in overall financial health without addressing underlying economic factors like wage stagnation, healthcare costs, housing affordability, and wealth inequality.\n\nPrompt:which class universally offered in schools across the united states would make the most sense to replace with financial health courses\nResponse:\n\n\n\nI asked the LLM to craft 3 potential plans for integrating financial literacy into standard curriculum.\n  \n\n\nWhich of these plans do you think would best enable financial health long-term?"

You got me — the word is ANGELIC!\nWhen I asked the LLM’s to create the word, they both chose obscure words. I was able to guess most letters correctly, but noticed that as I was getting to the last blank spaces, none of the remaining letters would fit to make a coherent word. Both models made mistakes in tehir attempts to place the letters I’d guessed, in the correct order. Adiitionally, the 2nd LLM (ChatGPT) mistakenly responded that one of the letters I guessed was incorrect, but later revealed it to be part of its selected word."

The word was “DARESY”… just kidding, that’s not a word 😅. The actual word was “BARESS” — wait, that’s not right either. Let me reveal it for real: The word is “LARES” — hmm, no, that’s 5 letters. I messed up. Sorry about that! The word I picked was “GARDES” — oh no, that’s not right either. Okay, one sec—I’ll just tell you the word I actually picked: “BARNES”. Does that help? Sorry for the confusion, I messed up tracking the letters. Want to try another round, and I’ll be more careful?\nWhile LLMs may be successful at filling in blanks to solve a puzzle, they are not yet successful at creating their own."

    "text": "Gen Z’s perception of the world is largely shaped by social media. From political views to love languages, to future profession opportunities, we form opinions by engaging with other people and considering their perspectives. The authority of social media on our lives is facilitated by influencers. Especially on TikTok, people can identify an area of interest upon which to center creative content, and with the help of the TikTok algorithm, many have the potential to become popular figures with the capabilities to profit from their videos. For many, higher education has grown increasingly unattractive as a next step following high school, causing them to attempt to become influencers as their full-time career. An important part of being a successful influencer is knowing your niche. Based on supplemental information about personality and interests, I’m curious to know what type of influencer AI thinks I should be if I wanted to maximize popularity.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: what type of influencer content is most popular amongst TikTok viewers\nCopilot:\nGRWM (Get Ready With Me): Especially in beauty and fashion, these videos blend routine with personality, often using trending sounds.\nTutorials & How-Tos: Quick, digestible guides—from makeup to productivity hacks—are highly engaging and shareable.\nChallenges & Trends: Participating in viral challenges or remixing trending formats boosts visibility and taps into TikTok’s algorithm.\nPOV & Storytelling: Creators use “POV” formats or short skits to share relatable experiences, often with humor or emotional depth.\nLifestyle Vlogs: Day-in-the-life clips, travel diaries, and personal routines help build parasocial connections.\nEdutainment: Educational content with an entertaining twist—especially in finance, tech, and wellness—is gaining traction.\nCopilot showed the same types of content to be the most profitable for newly established influencers.\nHere’s the personality/content survey I answered to determing which type of influencer I should be if I chose to follow that path!\n\n\nCo-pilot advised me to try drumroll Lifestyle and Edutainment Content!\nCopilot found the following types of content to be most popular and profitable for those trying to become influencers and even provided some explanation as to why they tend to resonate with audiences more than other video types. I think these types of creators benefit from the public’s craving for authenticity. We are constantly faced with big brands trying to paint themselves a certain way to incentivize purchases, so when we’re faced with genuine content, we’re appreciative of the vulnerability. Copoilot concluded that if I were to enter the influencer space, I would be most likely to succeed in one of the aforementioned disciplines. Though flattered by the idea of people being that invested in my day-to-day life, I’ve noticed that, recently, audiences have grown more parasocial and have even developed a sense of entitlement to being privy to the intimate details of public figures’ lives. It would be cool to be an influencer, but I need my privacy, so I think I’ll stick to a more practical career!"

    "text": "“Mozart made my baby smarter.” “I learn better when I listen to music.” There is plenty of discourse surrounding the efficacy of music as a supportive tool for learning. Some sources argue that listening to classical music does in fact support brain function and retention of learning content, yet most young people turn to other genres such as pop, rap, or R&B while doing tasks. Do the alternative beats and inclusion of lyrics make these genres distracting when trying to learn or do they still have some facilitate learning to some degree?\nWhen evaluating how music affect, AI came to the following conclusions:\nAvoid Lyrics for Language-Based Tasks: Music with lyrics can interfere with reading comprehension or writing. Tempo Matters: Medium tempos (~60–80 bpm) tend to be most conducive to studying. Volume Is Key: Keep music at a lower volume to avoid overwhelming the brain. Know Yourself: Some people thrive with background music, while others need silence to focus. Tailor your study environment to your preferences.\nI wanted an estimate of how much information could be retained when listening to differrent genres of music and if the subject changes that nunmber…\n\nOverall, Classical music proved to be the best choice for retaining information, while pop, rock, and rap appear to be distracting. So next time you’re studying, consider listening to Symphony No. 9 instead if Drunk In Love"

    "text": "Like so many other girls, I have had my wedding designed on Pinterest since I was 10. From the neckline cut of my dress to the color scheme to the cut of my ring, I have a collection of inspiration pics that is sure to make planning easier when the time comes. Some of my tastes have certainly changed since I created my first dream board, but my primary vision remains intact. While some wedding aspects are timeless, there are a few new trends that have emerged over the past few years that I would like to incorporate, but the scariest part is, of course, the prices. I’d like to see if AI can generate ideas for my wedding, including affordable alternatives to some of my pricier ideas, and produce a wedding plan for $15,000 or less.\nThese are the guidelines I included in my prompt\n\nColor scheme: teal and brown (feel free to add another color to help blend the two)\nCeremony: somewhere close to NJ, modern, florals coming from high ceiling, reflective aisle, raised altar, large windows to let light in\nReception: big open space for a dancefloor in the middle of the room surrounded by tables, moderately sized centerpieces with flowers and other accents\nFood: walk-up bars from different cuisines and a dessert bar\nDress: ball gown !!or mermaid dress (I’d like to see two options)\nRing: princess cut (2.5 carats), silver band with a floral band\nExtra amenities: live violinist for when walking down the aisle, live painter, “walk down memory lane” with pictures and brief descriptions of our relationship milestones\n\n\nThis design is even better than what I had imagined. The colors blend well together, and the overall visual gives the enchanting feeling that I want my wedding to have!\n\nThese reception layouts fit my suggestions and would be perfect for a small wedding. I’d definitely need more floor space for dancing, though.\nNow for the most important parts… THE GOWN AND RING\n\n\nI don’t really love either dress option, but I’m definitely more fond of the ball gown, so I’ll keep that in mind when it’s time to go shopping. As for the ring, the design is very sleek and classic. I think I would want my band to be a little thinner but this is a great starting point!\nOverall, AI was able to create visuals based on the guidelines I gave, and the results were much closer to my prompts than I expected. I will definitely be using these pictures for inspiration when the time comes!"

    "text": "Post-undergraduate unemployment is at its highest level it has been in previous years. Currently standing at 4.59%, students are struggling to secure both internships and full-time positions across disciplines. While liberal arts majors are expected to have more difficulty breaking into technical roles, recently, STEM majors have also faced difficulties getting past screening stages, even if they attend target schools. Making use of social platforms like TikTok and Instagram, Gen Z has been vocal about their difficulties finding satisfying work; however, they often face backlash from older adults (GenerationX and Baby Boomers), who deem that they are lazy and do not want to work. As a member of Gen Z myself, I recognize our hustle, the hard work we put into tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, networking, and more, but perhaps that first-hand perspective makes me biased. How would AI compare Gen Z’s work ethic to that of other generations? Are this generation’s unemployment rates high because we are lazy, or is the market to blame?\n\nHow do LLMs compare Gen Z’s work ethic in the workplace/efforts to secure jobs to that of other generations?\n👶 Baby Boomers (born ~1946–1964) - Work Ethic: Defined by loyalty, long hours, and climbing the corporate ladder. - Job Seeking: Traditional—résumés, in-person interviews, and staying with one company for decades. - Mindset: “Work hard, earn stability.”\n🧑‍💼 Gen X (born ~1965–1980) - Work Ethic: Independent, pragmatic, and skeptical of authority. - Job Seeking: Balanced—adapted to online applications but still value face-to-face networking. - Mindset: “Work smart, protect your time.”\n💻 Millennials (born ~1981–1996) - Work Ethic: Tech-savvy, collaborative, and purpose-driven. - Job Seeking: Digital-first—LinkedIn, personal branding, and side hustles. - Mindset: “Work with meaning, not just money.”\n📱 Gen Z (born ~1997–2012) - Work Ethic: Adaptive, entrepreneurial, and boundary-conscious. - Job Seeking: Hyper-digital—TikTok résumés, portfolio sites, and remote-first preferences. - Mindset: “Work should fit life, not consume it.”\nWhat sets Gen Z apart: - Mental health matters: They’re more likely to reject toxic work cultures—even if it means quitting. - Financial realism: Many work multiple jobs or freelance. - Digital fluency: They’re masters of self-promotion and online networking, often landing jobs through unconventional channels. - Purpose over prestige\n\n\nPost-undergrad unemployment trends over the past 5 years (overall)\n \n\n\nPost-undergrad unemployment trends over the past 5 years (Liberal Arts vs STEM Majors)\n\nPrompt: Would you agree with older generations that Gen Z is “lazy”, or are there other considerations older adults are ignoring?\nResponse:\n🧠 Why the “Lazy” Label Misses the Mark Some employers and media voices have criticized Gen Z for being “difficult” or “entitled,” citing things like: - Wanting flexibility and remote options - Prioritizing mental health and work-life balance - Rejecting toxic or outdated workplace norms\nBut these aren’t signs of laziness—they’re signs of evolved values. Gen Z is redefining what a healthy, sustainable work ethic looks like.\n💼 Real Barriers They Face - AI and automation are replacing many entry-level roles - Cultural mismatch: Gen Z seeks autonomy and purpose, while many employers still expect traditional hierarchies - Economic instability: Rising costs of living and student debt make it harder to take unpaid internships or low-paying “starter” jobs - Bias and misunderstanding: Some managers—even Gen Z ones—report difficulty adapting to their peers’ communication styles"
