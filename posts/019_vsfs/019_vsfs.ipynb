    "The beauty standards for women have always been fickle in the United States. Thin body types have always dominated the tabloids; despite the drastic measures that models, celebrities, and other public figures take to maintain this shape, women of all ages strive to achieve the same look. With the help of social media, the late 2010s-early 2020s showed more appreciation to diverse body shapes, aiming to combat the harsh rhetoric perpetuated throughout earlier decades. This era of of \"body positivity\" helped many women to mend their relationships with food and love their bodies. Brands like Victoria's Secret were condemned for upholding near impossible expectations, and due to the pressures of female audiences began to introduce different body shapes into their catologues, websites, and most notable their annual fashion show. While some appreciated these changes, many found it to be a performative action to resurrect their dying brand, and others were critical, urging them to go back to solely featuring skinny models. Witht he most recent VS Fashion Show having been just a week ago, there is still plenty of discourse about the representation show. Having strayed from their original \"brand\", I'm curious to know how AI would claddify VS' new position. Can AI generate the \"ideal VS Angel\" for each of these decades? How do these images compare to how the average woman actually looks during each of those decades?"
