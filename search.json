    "text": "I recently had a friend tell me about her boyfriend‚Äôs startup that is working to create an AI system that can match a user‚Äôs texting style through voice typing. While most phones already come with a voice typing feature, they are programmed to always type in American English; however, most people text using shorthand, slang, and capitalization for emphasis, which voice typing does not currently recognize. They aim to program AI so that it can recognize those patterns in a person‚Äôs typing patterns, so that when they use voice messaging, it will produce messages that match that person‚Äôs texting style. This piqued my interest in AI‚Äôs current ability to recognize and match texting patterns. I therefore provided AI with screenshots of some of my text conversations to see if AI could respond to a prompt using the same logic and communication style as the person I was texting.\n\nI was surprised to see that the AI would not attempt to mimic the style. I found the language most interesting: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable‚Ä¶This could feel like I‚Äôm impersonating‚Ä¶‚Äù. The response has a level of sentience that makes AI seem also personable rather than an objective mechanical program. With all of the conversation about the ethical implications of AI, it‚Äôs ironic that AI‚Äôs response to this prompt communicates ethical misalignment with the request, despite being successful at recognizing the logic and communication patterns and declaring itself capable of imitating them when prompted."

    "text": "I grew up watching reality shows like Dance Moms and Bring It! Both shows focus on a group of about 7 young girls who travel and dance competitively every week. While viewers get to watch the girls compete and grow in their craft, a large portion of each episode revolves around the drama between their competitive moms, all of whom desire that their child be the star of their studio. I enjoyed watching the drama when I was younger to the point where I would pick my favorite dancer and mom and pick sides during their arguments. However, rewatching these shows at an older age, I realize the potential damage done to each child‚Äôs psychological health as a result of growing up in such hectic, hostile environments. The general public tends to argue that, though both shows put the girls in stressful situations due to all of the travel and new choreography that they have to juggle on top of school, the girls featured on Dance Moms had worse experiences than those on Bring It! I wanted to see if AI would be able to form an opinion on the environments of each show and conclude whether or not reality TV in general could be considered a safe environment for children.\n\n\n\nChat GPT was able to identify differences in the structure of each show, causing one to have produce more harmful outcomes for the young cast members. For bith shows, the competitive stress that caused the children to value perfection over performance and over-bearing schedule of being featured on reality tv were primary stressors for the children on both shows. However, AI identified the coaching styles as a distinguishing factor. The coach of dance moms placed intense pressure on the girls and promoted internal competition between teammates that viewers joined in on, leading dancers less favored to be heavily scrutinized by the public. The coach of Bring it, on the other hand, promoted community through mentorship. By not dividing the team, her leadership style enticed the viewing audience to root for the team as a whole. Bring It was decided ot be an overall healthier environment compared to Dance Moms because it fostered growth rather than stifling emotional development. When asked to generalize, AI concluded that reality tv is not a safe environment for children because of the immense pressure and lack of protection against public scrutiny."
