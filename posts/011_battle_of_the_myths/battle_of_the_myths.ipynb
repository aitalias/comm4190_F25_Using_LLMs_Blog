    "AI allows us to bring even our most fantastical ideas to life through generative imagery. Greek mythology tells stories of fierce battles between heroic demigods and mythological creatures. While we can picture some of the classics (centaur, cyclops, hydra), I'm curious to know what other mutated, hybrid creatures AI can help us to envision. Which combinations would prove to be strong competitors, and which hybrids would be less intimidating than we might think? Lastly, how would these creatures pair up against each other? Let's have AI take us through a hypothetical knockout competition!"
