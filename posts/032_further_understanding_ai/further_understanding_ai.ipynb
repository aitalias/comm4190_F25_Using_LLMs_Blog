    "**Current Thoughts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "So I've been making my way through Unmasking AI by Joy Buolamwini, and I just hit around page 150. What's really sticking with me from this section is how she breaks down the actual mechanics of how AI systems fail. But she doesn't do it in a boring, textbook way. Instead, she uses these really concrete examples that make you go \"oh wow, that's actually terrifying.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that jumped out at me is how she explains the whole training data problem. Basically, if you're building a facial recognition system and you only feed it photos of white men, it's going to be really good at recognizing white men and absolutely terrible at recognizing everyone else. She shows how this isn't just a small glitch, but it's baked into how these systems are designed from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I appreciate is that she doesn't just point fingers; she actually walks through how she discovered these failures in her own research. At one point, she's testing facial recognition software on herself, and the system doesn't detect her face until she puts on a white mask. That's the algorithm literally not seeing her as human until she makes herself look white. It's such a powerful image, and it really drives home that these supposedly \"objective\" systems aren't truly objective.\n",

    "**Questions and Reflections**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What specific technical concepts does the author explain, and how accessible are these explanations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "She breaks down concepts like training data bias and accuracy rates across demographics. The explanations are really accessible because she uses real-world examples instead of heavy jargon. Even without a computer science background, you can follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How does the author connect technical failures to broader social issues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "She consistently links algorithmic failures back to systemic racism and sexism. When facial recognition fails on darker-skinned faces, she connects it to historical patterns of who gets seen and valued in society.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **What examples of algorithmic harm does she provide?**\n",
    "\n",
    "She talks about facial recognition misidentifying people, which can lead to wrongful arrests. She also discusses how these\n",
    "systems are deployed in ways that disproportionately affect marginalized communities—especially in policing contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does the author discuss the role of tech companies**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does she characterize their responsibility? Yes, she's critical of how tech companies prioritize speed and profit over thorough testing. She calls for these institutions to consider who might be harmed by their systems before rushing them to market."
