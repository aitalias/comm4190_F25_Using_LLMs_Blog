    "text": "Gen Z’s perception of the world is largely shaped by social media. From political views to love languages, to future profession opportunities, we form opinions by engaging with other people and considering their perspectives. The authority of social media on our lives is facilitated by influencers. Especially on TikTok, people can identify an area of interest upon which to center creative content, and with the help of the TikTok algorithm, many have the potential to become popular figures with the capabilities to profit from their videos. For many, higher education has grown increasingly unattractive as a next step following high school, causing them to attempt to become influencers as their full-time career. An important part of being a successful influencer is knowing your niche. Based on supplemental information about personality and interests, I’m curious to know what type of influencer AI thinks I should be if I wanted to maximize popularity.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: what type of influencer content is most popular amongst TikTok viewers\nCopilot:\nGRWM (Get Ready With Me): Especially in beauty and fashion, these videos blend routine with personality, often using trending sounds.\nTutorials & How-Tos: Quick, digestible guides—from makeup to productivity hacks—are highly engaging and shareable.\nChallenges & Trends: Participating in viral challenges or remixing trending formats boosts visibility and taps into TikTok’s algorithm.\nPOV & Storytelling: Creators use “POV” formats or short skits to share relatable experiences, often with humor or emotional depth.\nLifestyle Vlogs: Day-in-the-life clips, travel diaries, and personal routines help build parasocial connections.\nEdutainment: Educational content with an entertaining twist—especially in finance, tech, and wellness—is gaining traction.\nCopilot showed the same types of content to be the most profitable for newly established influencers.\nHere’s the personality/content survey I answered to determing which type of influencer I should be if I chose to follow that path!\n\n\nCo-pilot advised me to try drumroll Lifestyle and Edutainment Content!\nCopilot found the following types of content to be most popular and profitable for those trying to become influencers and even provided some explanation as to why they tend to resonate with audiences more than other video types. I think these types of creators benefit from the public’s craving for authenticity. We are constantly faced with big brands trying to paint themselves a certain way to incentivize purchases, so when we’re faced with genuine content, we’re appreciative of the vulnerability. Copoilot concluded that if I were to enter the influencer space, I would be most likely to succeed in one of the aforementioned disciplines. Though flattered by the idea of people being that invested in my day-to-day life, I’ve noticed that, recently, audiences have grown more parasocial and have even developed a sense of entitlement to being privy to the intimate details of public figures’ lives. It would be cool to be an influencer, but I need my privacy, so I think I’ll stick to a more practical career!"

    "text": "Growing up, my friends and I would take Buzzfeed quizzes to see which TV characters we were most like, which aesthetic fits us, what our personality types were, etc. These quizzes always set questions that used facts like our favorite foods and musical artists to produce an answer, but now that AI can come up with new introspective questions on the spot, I thought it would be fun if, using my answers to questions it comes up with, AI would be able to accurately guess my zodiac sign. I gave 2 different platforms the same prompt to see what kind of questions I got. Though the zodiac sign is a fun, light-hearted concept to test, some people use AI to figure out potential career paths and to make big decisions, so seeing the type of questions AI asks provides insight into how it uses context to respond to users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe systems produced different questions, but both asked about problem-solving style, how I respond to conflict, and other questions about how I conduct myself in my daily life to guess my Zodiac sign. Neither guessed correctly, but when I revealed my sign, both provided reasoning as to why my answers at least partially reflect what’s expected for the sign while also identifying deviations and explaining how a different answer to 1 question would have changed their conclusion. Both systems expanded on the reasoning and logic behind their guesses, unlike Buzzfeed quizzes. There is little need for Buzzfeed to provide reasoning for their results since the platform is used mainly by children, AI is often used for high stakes decision-making, thus users having insight into how responses are crafted are important for choosing whether or not to act on AI’s recommendations."

    "text": "I grew up watching reality shows like Dance Moms and Bring It! Both shows focus on a group of about 7 young girls who travel and dance competitively every week. While viewers get to watch the girls compete and grow in their craft, a large portion of each episode revolves around the drama between their competitive moms, all of whom desire that their child be the star of their studio. I enjoyed watching the drama when I was younger to the point where I would pick my favorite dancer and mom and pick sides during their arguments. However, rewatching these shows at an older age, I realize the potential damage done to each child’s psychological health as a result of growing up in such hectic, hostile environments. The general public tends to argue that, though both shows put the girls in stressful situations due to all of the travel and new choreography that they have to juggle on top of school, the girls featured on Dance Moms had worse experiences than those on Bring It! I wanted to see if AI would be able to form an opinion on the environments of each show and conclude whether or not reality TV in general could be considered a safe environment for children.\nChat GPT was able to identify differences in the structure of each show, causing one to have produce more harmful outcomes for the young cast members. For bith shows, the competitive stress that caused the children to value perfection over performance and over-bearing schedule of being featured on reality tv were primary stressors for the children on both shows. However, AI identified the coaching styles as a distinguishing factor. The coach of dance moms placed intense pressure on the girls and promoted internal competition between teammates that viewers joined in on, leading dancers less favored to be heavily scrutinized by the public. The coach of Bring it, on the other hand, promoted community through mentorship. By not dividing the team, her leadership style enticed the viewing audience to root for the team as a whole. Bring It was decided ot be an overall healthier environment compared to Dance Moms because it fostered growth rather than stifling emotional development. When asked to generalize, AI concluded that reality tv is not a safe environment for children because of the immense pressure and lack of protection against public scrutiny."

    "text": "The months of August and September featured extensive online discourse about the promotional ad by GAP starring Katseye and the ad by American Eagle starring Sydney Sweeney. Many critiqued American Eagle’s ad being an homage to the distasteful Calvin Klein ad that starred an underage Brooke Shields in 1980. In addition to backlash for remaking an ad already deemed inappropriate, American Eagle was also condemned for using language that seemingly idealizes genetics like Sydney Sweeney’s and promotes white supremacist narratives. GAP, oppositionally cast a Global girl group that featured members from diverse backgrounds and delivered a message of fun, versatility, and acceptance. After using AI to see the performance statistics of these ads across platforms, I plan to see if AI can break down audience response to the two ads by different demographics, including age, racial group, and region. Finally, I want to see AI’s opinion of the two ads.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: in 3 sentences, what is your main takeaway from public discourse about Gap’s and American Eagle’s most recent jeans ads\nCopilot: Public discourse around Gap and American Eagle’s 2025 jeans ads highlights a stark contrast in strategy: Gap’s “Better in Denim” campaign was praised for its inclusive, dance-driven celebration featuring global girl group KATSEYE2. Meanwhile, American Eagle’s ad with Sydney Sweeney sparked controversy over its “good genes” pun, drawing criticism for tone-deaf messaging and perceived eugenics undertones3. The conversation underscores how authenticity and cultural sensitivity can drive positive engagement, while provocative tactics risk backlash—even if they generate buzz.\nMe: what are the total performance metrics (likes, shares, clicks to website) of each ad across platforms\nCopilot provided the following\n\nGap’s campaign leaned into cultural resonance and inclusivity, while American Eagle’s shock-value strategy drove massive reach and customer acquisition. If you’d like, I can help visualize this comparison or track future updates.\nI then prompted it to rate audience approval across different demographics.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot successfully presented me with metrics showing the cumulative success of each ad and communicated the general reactions of audience members from various demographics. These breakdowns showed the GAP ad to be unanimously preferred to American Eagle’s. Most of the social discourse I’d seen criticized the discriminatory undertones of the American Eagle ad, so I wasn’t surprised to see this reflected in the ratings. I agree with AI’s conclusion that GAP’s inclusive casting and modernization of an old song made it resonate with such a broad audience and was the key to their success. If other brands want to see similar trends, they would benefit from following Gap’s example; however, I wonder if audiences would perceive it as a shift towards a more inclusive culture or an inauthentic, desperate cash-grab attempt."

    "text": "Skincare remains a trending topic on social media, sparking critique from people of diverse backgrounds. Its popularity has enabled thousands of people to build their own brands by sharing their go-to products and doing brand reviews with company sponsorships. We constantly see public figures deploying new skincare lines, despite there already being a multitude of functional products on the market, yet their products still sell due to their status. I’m curious about how people choose to craft their skincare routines: do they value consistency and predictability, or novelty? I prompted AI to decide what factors most people tend to consider when developing their skin routine, how those considerations change based on age group, and provide a recommendation for my skincare routine based on the products I’m currently using.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: In two sentences, how do you think social media has influenced people’s skincare practices\nCopilot: Social media has amplified skincare trends and product recommendations, often driven by influencers and viral content, making routines more accessible but also more commercialized. It’s also fostered greater awareness of ingredients and skin conditions, encouraging people to research and personalize their skincare choices.\nMe: when consumers are choosing products what do you think they pay attention to the most:consistency and predictability, or novelty\nCopilot: It depends on the context—consumers tend to value consistency and predictability when it comes to essentials like skincare, food, or household items, where reliability and trust matter most. But when shopping for fashion, tech, or entertainment, novelty often wins, driven by curiosity, trends, and the desire for something fresh or exciting.\nI then prompted copilot to provide an estimate of how much weight each characteristic carries when consumers are purchasing skincare products. AI responded with the following chart:\n\nOut of curiosity, I wanted to see what products AI would recommend for my routine based on current trends and the following supplemental information:\n\nAI recognizes social media’s influence on how people perceive skincare and even acknowledges the risk of being misled due to the commercialization of sponsored products. Though audiences require greater awareness of potential false advertisements, social media has enabled the public to grow more aware of what they’re putting on their skin while also fostering a sense of unity/community amongst those who have become insecure due to their skin. The majority of people self-treat skin-related issues rather than seeking professional help, and when deciding what to use, AI finds that though the majority of the population values consistency & predictability, Gen Z finds novelty and innovation slightly more favorable. AI was also able to provide me with a custom skincare routine to address some of my problem areas, and like the rest of my generation, I might take its advice."

    "text": "Animation styles have evolved over the years as new technological capabilities have allowed them to do so. Innovation has enabled companies to transition from black-and-white to colored content, from 2D to 3D styles, and more. These new possibilities invite more diverse designs; however, there is often pushback against changed styles for franchises that remain active for extended periods. For example, the Shrek movies have been enjoyed by viewers across generations; however, the trailers for the most recent film revealed drastic changes in animation, which fueled critiques from fans of the classics. Is nostalgia stopping viewers from embracing new styles, or are certain types of animation inherently more appealing to viewers regardless of previous exposure to similar content? Let’s see what AI thinks about competing ideas in animation.\nAI has recognized significant changes in animation styles over the past four decades, identifying components such as line work, color vibrancy, and character expressionism as distinguishing details. While 90’s animations are recognized for “squiggly lines and expressive character designs” made famous by groups like Klasky-Csupo, this decade’s animations are praised for “highly polished animation with dynamic lighting and detailed backgrounds.”\n\n\nThis evolution of styles diversifies content, but how do different generations feel about new animation features?\n\nDespite each generation’s preferences, the general consensus about the shift from 90s techniques to modern animation is the following…\n\nUltimately, I sought to determine if AI could generate images that mimicked the animation styles of these two decades. Can you guess which image represents each decade?"

    "text": "I recently had a friend tell me about her boyfriend’s startup that is working to create an AI system that can match a user’s texting style through voice typing. While most phones already come with a voice typing feature, they are programmed to always type in American English; however, most people text using shorthand, slang, and capitalization for emphasis, which voice typing does not currently recognize. They aim to program AI so that it can recognize those patterns in a person’s typing patterns, so that when they use voice messaging, it will produce messages that match that person’s texting style. This piqued my interest in AI’s current ability to recognize and match texting patterns. I therefore provided AI with screenshots of some of my text conversations to see if AI could respond to a prompt using the same logic and communication style as the person I was texting.\n\nI was surprised to see that the AI would not attempt to mimic the style. I found the language most interesting: “I’m uncomfortable…This could feel like I’m impersonating…”. The response has a level of sentience that makes AI seem also personable rather than an objective mechanical program. With all of the conversation about the ethical implications of AI, it’s ironic that AI’s response to this prompt communicates ethical misalignment with the request, despite being successful at recognizing the logic and communication patterns and declaring itself capable of imitating them when prompted."
