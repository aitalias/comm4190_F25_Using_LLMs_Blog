    "Gen Z's perception of the world is largely shaped by social media. From political views to love languages, to future profession opportunities, we form opinions by engaging with other people and considering their perspectives. The authority of social media on our lives is facilitated by influencers. Especially on TikTok, people can identify an area of interest upon which to center creative content, and with the help of the TikTok algorithm, many have the potential to become popular figures with the capabilities to profit from their videos. For many, higher education has grown increasingly unattractive as a next step following high school, causing them to attempt to become influencers as their full-time career. An important part of being a successful influencer is knowing your niche. Based on supplemental information about personality and interests, I'm curious to know what type of influencer AI thinks I should be if I wanted to maximize popularity."

    "Copilot found the following types of content to be most popular and profitable for those trying to become influencers and even provided some explanation as to why they tend to resonate with audiences more than other video types. I think these types of creators benefit from the public's craving for authenticity. We are constantly faced with big brands trying to paint themselves a certain way to incentivize purchases, so when we're faced with genuine content, we're appreciative of the vulnerability. Copoilot concluded that if I were to enter the influencer space, I would be most likely to succeed in one of the aforementioned disciplines. Though flattered by the idea of people being that invested in my day-to-day life, I've noticed that, recently, audiences have grown more parasocial and have even developed a sense of entitlement to being privy to the intimate details of public figures' lives. It would be cool to be an influencer, but I need my privacy, so I think I'll stick to a more practical career!"
