    "I have a younger sister and younger cousin who, during their K-2nd-grade years, I would frequently help as they were learning to read. I'd look at the drills they were given, and most of the work was focused on memorizing sight words. I've seen similar trends discussed by parents on TikTok, revealing that early education language arts curricula have strayed towards memorization and away from phonics, which is fundamental to understanding how letter sounds work together to form words. Upon conducting further research, I was dumbfounded to learn that 60% of Americans are functionally illiterate. How can we revise curricula to maintain modernity without losing concepts that are foundational to advanced learning, and how can AI help?"

    " - 54% of adults have literacy skills below a sixth-grade level\n",
    " - The literacy rate has decreased nearly 10 points since 2017\n",

    "I was intrigued by the drastic drop in scores between 2017 and 2023 and was curious to know what factors may have contributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Increased Screen Time and Digital Distractions**\n",
    "    - The shift toward smartphones, social media, and short-form content has reduced time spent on sustained reading.\n",
    "    - Americans are reading less deeply and for shorter periods, which weakens comprehension and critical thinking skills.\n",
    "3. **Pandemic-Related Learning Loss**\n",
    "    - COVID-19 school closures created significant educational disruptions, particularly for younger students during critical literacy development years.\n",
    "    - Remote learning was less effective for teaching foundational reading skills, and many students haven't fully recovered.\n",
    "4. **Inadequate Reading Instruction Methods**\n",
    "    - Many schools moved away from phonics-based instruction in favor of other approaches that haven't proven as effective.\n",
    "    - The \"reading wars\" between different pedagogical methods has left some students without solid foundational skills.\n",
    "5. **Socioeconomic Disparities**\n",
    "    - Poverty, limited access to books at home, underfunded schools in low-income areas, and lack of early childhood education all create barriers to literacy development.\n",
    "6. **Declining Reading Culture**\n",
    "    - There's been a broader cultural shift away from reading for pleasure.\n",
    "    - Fewer families prioritize reading at home, libraries face funding cuts, and competing entertainment options have made reading seem less appealing, especially to young people."
