    "There are numerous eating fads and workout routines available today, thanks to social platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Whenever I see a girl with an idealized physique pop up on my feed, the comments are filled with viewers asking for her gym routine and meal plan, even if the video is completely unrelated. While it's great that people are thinking more consciously about their lifestyle habits, often, their motivations are rooted in aesthetics rather than overall health. Even with inclusive campaigns like the body positivity movement, body image still controls so many people, especially women, and thus, any new behaviors are merely temporary. I want to see if AI can help me uncover the secrets to establishing healthy habits, so that lifestyle changes can be maintained long-term. I'd also like to understand the role of mental health in these processes."

    "- Social Media Algorithms\n",
    "    Increased promotion of \"girl routines\" and \"what I eat in a day\" content\n",
    "- Visibility of GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy)\n",

    "- Backlash Fatigue\n",
