    "The Wordle took the world by storm when it first emerged in October of 2021, incentivizing millions to compete with their friends to see who could guess the daily word in the fewest number of tries. Although I've never had a streak longer than 4 days, I'd like to see if I can guess the correct word in fewer tries than three LLMs."
