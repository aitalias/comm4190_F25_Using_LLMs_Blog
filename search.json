    "text": "Like so many other girls, I have had my wedding designed on Pinterest since I was 10. From the neckline cut of my dress to the color scheme to the cut of my ring, I have a collection of inspiration pics that is sure to make planning easier when the time comes. Some of my tastes have certainly changed since I created my first dream board, but my primary vision remains intact. While some wedding aspects are timeless, there are a few new trends that have emerged over the past few years that I would like to incorporate, but the scariest part is, of course, the prices. I’d like to see if AI can generate ideas for my wedding, including affordable alternatives to some of my pricier ideas, and produce a wedding plan for $15,000 or less.\nThese are the guidelines I included in my prompt\n\nColor scheme: teal and brown (feel free to add another color to help blend the two)\nCeremony: somewhere close to NJ, modern, florals coming from high ceiling, reflective aisle, raised altar, large windows to let light in\nReception: big open space for a dancefloor in the middle of the room surrounded by tables, moderately sized centerpieces with flowers and other accents\nFood: walk-up bars from different cuisines and a dessert bar\nDress: ball gown !!or mermaid dress (I’d like to see two options)\nRing: princess cut (2.5 carats), silver band with a floral band\nExtra amenities: live violinist for when walking down the aisle, live painter, “walk down memory lane” with pictures and brief descriptions of our relationship milestones\n\n\nThis design is even better than what I had imagined. The colors blend well together, and the overall visual gives the enchanting feeling that I want my wedding to have!\n\nThese reception layouts fit my suggestions and would be perfect for a small wedding. I’d definitely need more floor space for dancing, though.\nNow for the most important parts… THE GOWN AND RING\n\n\nI don’t really love either dress option, but I’m definitely more fond of the ball gown, so I’ll keep that in mind when it’s time to go shopping. As for the ring, the design is very sleek and classic. I think I would want my band to be a little thinner but this is a great starting point!\nOverall, AI was able to create visuals based on the guidelines I gave, and the results were much closer to my prompts than I expected. I will definitely be using these pictures for inspiration when the time comes!"

    "text": "I recently had a friend tell me about her boyfriend’s startup that is working to create an AI system that can match a user’s texting style through voice typing. While most phones already come with a voice typing feature, they are programmed to always type in American English; however, most people text using shorthand, slang, and capitalization for emphasis, which voice typing does not currently recognize. They aim to program AI so that it can recognize those patterns in a person’s typing patterns, so that when they use voice messaging, it will produce messages that match that person’s texting style. This piqued my interest in AI’s current ability to recognize and match texting patterns. I therefore provided AI with screenshots of some of my text conversations to see if AI could respond to a prompt using the same logic and communication style as the person I was texting.\n\nI was surprised to see that the AI would not attempt to mimic the style. I found the language most interesting: “I’m uncomfortable…This could feel like I’m impersonating…”. The response has a level of sentience that makes AI seem also personable rather than an objective mechanical program. With all of the conversation about the ethical implications of AI, it’s ironic that AI’s response to this prompt communicates ethical misalignment with the request, despite being successful at recognizing the logic and communication patterns and declaring itself capable of imitating them when prompted."

    "text": "AI allows us to bring even our most fantastical ideas to life through generative imagery. Greek mythology tells stories of fierce battles between heroic demigods and mythological creatures. While we can picture some of the classics (centaur, cyclops, hydra), I’m curious to know what other mutated, hybrid creatures AI can help us to envision. Which combinations would prove to be strong competitors, and which hybrids would be less intimidating than we might think? Lastly, how would these creatures pair up against each other? Let’s have AI take us through a hypothetical knockout competition!\nWhat random animal hybrids can AI come up with by combining 1 of Earth’s fiercest creatures and one of the most docile?\n\n🐘🦛 1. Slothopotamus: Sloth + Hippopotamus = A slow-moving river guardian with mossy fur and a deceptively calm demeanor. Peaceful until provoked—then it charges like a tank.\n🦎🐰 2. Komobunny: Komodo Dragon + Rabbit = A stealthy burrower with venomous charm. It hops innocently but can unleash a toxic bite when threatened.\n🐜🐢 3. Fire Turtle: Fire Ant + Turtle = A shell-armored swarm commander. Normally serene, but when disturbed, it unleashes coordinated attacks from beneath its shell.\n🐃🦥 4. Buffasloth: Cape Buffalo + Sloth = A jungle wallflower with hidden rage. Moves slowly through trees but can stampede with terrifying force if cornered.\n🐘🦫 5. Elebeaver: Elephant + Beaver = A gentle ecosystem engineer with tusks. Builds dams with precision, but defends its territory with thunderous might.\n🦍🦦 6. Ottrilla: Gorilla + Otter = A playful river brute. Loves floating on its back and cracking shells—but has the strength to uproot trees if angered.\n🦡🐑 7. Weesheep: Least Weasel + Sheep = A deceptively cuddly predator. Looks like a wooly puffball, but defends its flock with lightning-fast strikes.\n🐼🦈 8. Pandark: Panda + Shark = A bamboo-loving ocean lurker. Peaceful on land, but underwater it’s a silent hunter with a taste for fish and flair.\n\nOut of these contenders, I think the Elebeaver will prove to be the fiercest competitor.\nLet’s see the matches AI generates!\n\nLooks like my top pick was knocked out in the first round :(\n\ncan you tell me the storyline of this torunament\n\nQuarterfinals:\nKomobunny outpaces and poisons the slow-moving Slothopotamus.\nFire Turtle uses swarm tactics and shell defense to outmaneuver Buffasloth.\nOttrilla outsmarts Elebeaver with agility and strength.\nPandark dominates Weesheep with stealth and aquatic power.\nSemifinals:\nFire Turtle overwhelms Komobunny with coordinated defense and strategic attacks.\nPandark defeats Ottrilla using dual-terrain advantage and silent strikes.\nFinals:\nPandark claims victory over Fire Turtle—its size, stealth, and versatility proving unbeatable.\nIt was interesting to see the storylines that AI created for each battle between these fictional creatures. I personally would have expected the Ottrilla (Otter + Gorilla hybrid) to be the victor, but I’m sure it put up a good fight!\nGive it up for the winner!"

    "text": "Today’s job market is a nightmare to break into. Highly sought-after positions are getting harder and harder to secure due to the mass number of applicants and the “game” that comes with applying. To get your foot in the door, you must do more than submit a resume; you have to attend networking events, do coffee chats, and send cold emails. It’s easy to fill out tens of applications, but the worst part of applying is writing the dreaded cover letter. Almost every job recruiting new grads expects a 2-400 letter essentially praising the company and explaining why you are a perfect match, but when everyone knows the recipe, how do you stand out? I’m going to write a letter for a current job posting using AI, each of us contributing 3 words at a time. I’ll compare the final product to a cover letter I have written myself for that same job and have AI decide which one would be most likely to move on to the interview round!\nBefore starting the writing process, I uploaded my resume so that the LLM can reference specific experiences and qualifications. Here’s the final result!\nDear L’Oréal Hiring Team, I’m excited to apply for the Marketing position and express my passion for beauty, wellness, and catering to diverse consumer needs. My prior experiences at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Johnson & Johnson have equipped me with skills crucial to driving brand growth through data analysis and strategic marketing initiatives. I align with L’Oréal’s commitment to innovation and consumer-focused initiatives that create meaningful impact and promote inclusivity across diverse cultural segments. I’m eager to leverage my cross-functional collaboration so that I can develop comprehensive marketing strategies that’ll inform product launches and optimize product performance long-term. My leadership roles in Strictly Funk Dance Company and Black Wharton Consulting have equipped me with P&L management experiences that have strengthened my ability to optimize spending for maximum profitability while maintaining focus on crucial brand objectives. I successfully prioritized spending areas and reduced operational costs, making this year’s budget more efficient. My skills and acumen position me to excel as a leader in L’Oréal’s dynamic environment. I hope to contribute innovative solutions and learn from adept professionals shaping beauty’s future. Thank you for considering my application. Sincerely, Aitalia Sharpe\nI used another LLM to rate this cover letter compared to the letter I wrote myself. I’ll definitely continue writing them myself going forward."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Animation styles have evolved over the years as new technological capabilities have allowed them to do so. Innovation has enabled companies to transition from black-and-white to colored content, from 2D to 3D styles, and more. These new possibilities invite more diverse designs; however, there is often pushback against changed styles for franchises that remain active for extended periods. For example, the Shrek movies have been enjoyed by viewers across generations; however, the trailers for the most recent film revealed drastic changes in animation, which fueled critiques from fans of the classics. Is nostalgia stopping viewers from embracing new styles, or are certain types of animation inherently more appealing to viewers regardless of previous exposure to similar content? Let’s see what AI thinks about competing ideas in animation.\nAI has recognized significant changes in animation styles over the past four decades, identifying components such as line work, color vibrancy, and character expressionism as distinguishing details. While 90’s animations are recognized for “squiggly lines and expressive character designs” made famous by groups like Klasky-Csupo, this decade’s animations are praised for “highly polished animation with dynamic lighting and detailed backgrounds.”\n\n\nThis evolution of styles diversifies content, but how do different generations feel about new animation features?\n\nDespite each generation’s preferences, the general consensus about the shift from 90s techniques to modern animation is the following…\n\nUltimately, I sought to determine if AI could generate images that mimicked the animation styles of these two decades. Can you guess which image represents each decade?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the dating circuit, whether you’re talking in person, through Tinder, or miming through a window, the conversation almost always turns to the question: “What’s your love language?” People then decide whether their favorite way to give or receive love is through words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, gift-giving, or acts of service. As of now, the answer to this question serves primarily as a fun fact or a guide to one’s partner for how to show interest, but I’m curious to know whether people’s love languages indicate combatibility. Are two people with the same love language most compatible or is there a combination of different languages that make a relationship more likely to succeed long-term? Let’s see what AI has to say!\n\nwhat are the pros and cons of love languages\n\nWhat’s good about love languages: * Improves communication: It helps people articulate their needs and understand their partner’s.\n\nReduces misunderstandings: Sometimes partners show love differently, so recognizing differing styles can ease friction.\nPromotes empathy: It shifts the focus from how you want to give love to how the other person receives it.\n\nThe caveats:\n\nIt’s not scientific: While based on observation, love languages haven’t been rigorously supported by psychological research. They’re more of a tool than a truth.\nPeople are dynamic: Your love language can change over time, or vary by context (e.g., romantic vs. platonic relationships).\nRelationships need more: Love languages aren’t a fix-all. They don’t replace boundaries, trust, or emotional maturity.\n\n\nIt seems AI thinks of love languages as a solid starting point for understanding a partner, but warns that they can be used as a crutch when trying to understand conflicts in a relationship.\n\n\nare there any love language combinations that are more compatible than others?\n\n\nQuality Time + Quality Time\n  Why it works: Both partners feel loved through shared presence and undivided attention.\nNatural synergy: They’re likely to spend meaningful time together, communicate well, and build emotional intimacy just by being with each other.\nActs of Service + Acts of Service\nWhy it works: Both express love by doing — helping, fixing, showing up.\nNatural synergy: They tend to notice and appreciate effort-based gestures. There’s a mutual understanding that love is action, not just words.\nWords of Affirmation + Physical Touch\n  Why it works: These two are highly expressive — one verbally, the other physically — and often reinforce each other.\n\n\nwhich combinations are the least compatible?\n\n\nWords of Affirmation + Acts of Service\n  Why it’s tough: One person is waiting to hear love, while the other thinks they’ve already shown it.\nCommon problem: “Why do I need to say it if I do it?” vs. “Why do you do things for me but never tell me how you feel?”\nReceiving Gifts + Physical Touch\n  Why it’s tough: One thrives on symbolic tokens, the other on presence and contact.\nDisconnect risk: The gift-oriented partner might feel shallow to the touch-oriented one, and vice versa — unless they learn to value each other’s gestures.\nQuality Time + Acts of Service\n  Why it’s tough: One partner might be busy doing things for the other (cleaning, errands), but not spending time with them — which leads to feeling unappreciated.\nMismatch dynamic: “I did all this for you!” vs. “I just wanted you to sit with me.”\n\n\nThere’s emphasis on the fact that a mismatched pair of love languages is not doomed; they require more conscious effort to succeed.\n\nWhen approaching reationships, I consider love languages as an interesting quality and something to consider when thinking about how to show care towards a person, and I was surprised to learned from AI that many people use it as a crucial factor for determining compatibility. While having the same love language would certainly be helpful, there are other factors such as emotional availability and long-term goals, that are vital to developing a healthy, sustainable relationship."

    "text": "Skincare remains a trending topic on social media, sparking critique from people of diverse backgrounds. Its popularity has enabled thousands of people to build their own brands by sharing their go-to products and doing brand reviews with company sponsorships. We constantly see public figures deploying new skincare lines, despite there already being a multitude of functional products on the market, yet their products still sell due to their status. I’m curious about how people choose to craft their skincare routines: do they value consistency and predictability, or novelty? I prompted AI to decide what factors most people tend to consider when developing their skin routine, how those considerations change based on age group, and provide a recommendation for my skincare routine based on the products I’m currently using.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: In two sentences, how do you think social media has influenced people’s skincare practices\nCopilot: Social media has amplified skincare trends and product recommendations, often driven by influencers and viral content, making routines more accessible but also more commercialized. It’s also fostered greater awareness of ingredients and skin conditions, encouraging people to research and personalize their skincare choices.\nMe: when consumers are choosing products what do you think they pay attention to the most:consistency and predictability, or novelty\nCopilot: It depends on the context—consumers tend to value consistency and predictability when it comes to essentials like skincare, food, or household items, where reliability and trust matter most. But when shopping for fashion, tech, or entertainment, novelty often wins, driven by curiosity, trends, and the desire for something fresh or exciting.\nI then prompted copilot to provide an estimate of how much weight each characteristic carries when consumers are purchasing skincare products. AI responded with the following chart:\n\nOut of curiosity, I wanted to see what products AI would recommend for my routine based on current trends and the following supplemental information:\n\nAI recognizes social media’s influence on how people perceive skincare and even acknowledges the risk of being misled due to the commercialization of sponsored products. Though audiences require greater awareness of potential false advertisements, social media has enabled the public to grow more aware of what they’re putting on their skin while also fostering a sense of unity/community amongst those who have become insecure due to their skin. The majority of people self-treat skin-related issues rather than seeking professional help, and when deciding what to use, AI finds that though the majority of the population values consistency & predictability, Gen Z finds novelty and innovation slightly more favorable. AI was also able to provide me with a custom skincare routine to address some of my problem areas, and like the rest of my generation, I might take its advice."

    "text": "The months of August and September featured extensive online discourse about the promotional ad by GAP starring Katseye and the ad by American Eagle starring Sydney Sweeney. Many critiqued American Eagle’s ad being an homage to the distasteful Calvin Klein ad that starred an underage Brooke Shields in 1980. In addition to backlash for remaking an ad already deemed inappropriate, American Eagle was also condemned for using language that seemingly idealizes genetics like Sydney Sweeney’s and promotes white supremacist narratives. GAP, oppositionally cast a Global girl group that featured members from diverse backgrounds and delivered a message of fun, versatility, and acceptance. After using AI to see the performance statistics of these ads across platforms, I plan to see if AI can break down audience response to the two ads by different demographics, including age, racial group, and region. Finally, I want to see AI’s opinion of the two ads.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: in 3 sentences, what is your main takeaway from public discourse about Gap’s and American Eagle’s most recent jeans ads\nCopilot: Public discourse around Gap and American Eagle’s 2025 jeans ads highlights a stark contrast in strategy: Gap’s “Better in Denim” campaign was praised for its inclusive, dance-driven celebration featuring global girl group KATSEYE2. Meanwhile, American Eagle’s ad with Sydney Sweeney sparked controversy over its “good genes” pun, drawing criticism for tone-deaf messaging and perceived eugenics undertones3. The conversation underscores how authenticity and cultural sensitivity can drive positive engagement, while provocative tactics risk backlash—even if they generate buzz.\nMe: what are the total performance metrics (likes, shares, clicks to website) of each ad across platforms\nCopilot provided the following\n\nGap’s campaign leaned into cultural resonance and inclusivity, while American Eagle’s shock-value strategy drove massive reach and customer acquisition. If you’d like, I can help visualize this comparison or track future updates.\nI then prompted it to rate audience approval across different demographics.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot successfully presented me with metrics showing the cumulative success of each ad and communicated the general reactions of audience members from various demographics. These breakdowns showed the GAP ad to be unanimously preferred to American Eagle’s. Most of the social discourse I’d seen criticized the discriminatory undertones of the American Eagle ad, so I wasn’t surprised to see this reflected in the ratings. I agree with AI’s conclusion that GAP’s inclusive casting and modernization of an old song made it resonate with such a broad audience and was the key to their success. If other brands want to see similar trends, they would benefit from following Gap’s example; however, I wonder if audiences would perceive it as a shift towards a more inclusive culture or an inauthentic, desperate cash-grab attempt."

    "title": "Breaking The Disney Kid Curse",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I remember when growing up, I wanted to be on TV like all of my favorite stars from Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. I saw being on this network as my launching point and confidently believed that I would grow up to be a world-renowned movie star like Taraji P. Henson or Regina Hall. I no longer want to be a famous Hollywood actor, but I still occasionally find myself looking into the child stars I used to love watching, and am surprised to see that, despite their efforts, many have failed to break into the industry and establish themselves as serious actors. I’ve seen the term “Disney Kid Curse” be used to address this phenomenon; those who’ve been prominent features on the channel struggle to secure mature roles because the public still sees them as the little kids they were introduced as. I want to see if AI can break down this phenomenon further and explore potential strategic choices that would maximize former Disney kids’ chance at achieving longevity as actors in the industry.\nWhen I first asked AI about it understanding of the “Disney Kid Curse”, it focused on the long-term personal issues that some child stars, like Lindsey Lohan, Demi Lovato, and Miley Cyrus, have experienced after becoming adults.\nOnce I clarified, AI revealed that child stars struggle to land more mature roles due to the following:\n\nAudience rejection - fans struggle to accept them outside their Disney persona\nIndustry skepticism - casting directors won’t consider them for serious dramatic roles\nBox office struggles - their post-Disney films often underperform\n\nThe audience rejection facet was not surprising to me. In my personal experience on social media, I have often come across child stars’ profiles. When they try posting amateur content, comments often refer to them by the name of their character or post popular memes from when they were younger.\nI wanted to dive deeper into which of these factors holds the most weight in their downward career trajectories, so I asked AI, “how do hollywood casting execs deal with a disney kid: do these actors struggle because they attempt to breakout and are rejcted, or do casting agents not even give them the chance?\nIt’s both, but primarily the latter - casting directors often don’t even give them a chance. The problem happens at the audition/consideration stage:\n\nThey’re not called in - For serious dramatic roles, casting directors filter Disney Kids out before they can prove themselves.\nPreemptive typecasting - Execs assume audiences won’t buy them in mature roles, so they don’t waste time auditioning them. It’s a business calculation about box office viability.\nAge demographic mismatch - Their fanbase skews young, but adult prestige films need audiences who… don’t associate them with tween sitcoms.\n\nWhen they do get auditions, it’s considered an uphill battle to not only land the role, but to prove to audiences that they have range.\nI then prompted AI with a hypothetical: “Pretend I’m Skai Jackson, who starred in the series, ‘Jessie’, and it is 2015 and the show has just ended. Make me a career plan to establish myself as a mature actress who could ideally reach Zendaya-level stardom.”\nPHASE 1: 2015-2017 - Strategic Distance & Credibility Building Immediate (2015-2016):\nTake a break. No new Disney projects. Let the “Jessie” association cool. Hire new representation - Get an agent known for career transformations (CAA/UTA), not Disney-pipeline agents Social media rebrand - Shift from bubbly kid content to thoughtful, socially conscious voice. Show maturity and substance. Target: One prestige indie film - Take a supporting role in a Sundance-type drama. Low pay, high credibility. Think something like The Hate U Give (if you can get in early) or similar coming-of-age with social weight.\n2017:\nGuest arc on prestige TV - Land a 3-4 episode arc on a critically acclaimed HBO/FX/Netflix drama. Not a lead, but a role that shows range. Think Euphoria-type content before Euphoria existed.\nPHASE 2: 2018-2020 - Prove Your Range 2018-2019:\nLead in festival indie film - Take the lead in a gritty independent film that premieres at Sundance/Toronto. Something that shows dramatic chops - abuse survivor, activist, complex teen navigating trauma. Awards campaign hustle - Do the festival circuit, press, interviews showing your intelligence and depth Voice work in animated prestige - Something like Spider-Verse - keeps you working, different audience\n2020:\nSupporting role in studio film - Not the lead yet, but a memorable supporting role in a film with A-list actors.

    "text": "I grew up watching reality shows like Dance Moms and Bring It! Both shows focus on a group of about 7 young girls who travel and dance competitively every week. While viewers get to watch the girls compete and grow in their craft, a large portion of each episode revolves around the drama between their competitive moms, all of whom desire that their child be the star of their studio. I enjoyed watching the drama when I was younger to the point where I would pick my favorite dancer and mom and pick sides during their arguments. However, rewatching these shows at an older age, I realize the potential damage done to each child’s psychological health as a result of growing up in such hectic, hostile environments. The general public tends to argue that, though both shows put the girls in stressful situations due to all of the travel and new choreography that they have to juggle on top of school, the girls featured on Dance Moms had worse experiences than those on Bring It!

For bith shows, the competitive stress that caused the children to value perfection over performance and over-bearing schedule of being featured on reality tv were primary stressors for the children on both shows. However, AI identified the coaching styles as a distinguishing factor. The coach of dance moms placed intense pressure on the girls and promoted internal competition between teammates that viewers joined in on, leading dancers less favored to be heavily scrutinized by the public. The coach of Bring it, on the other hand, promoted community through mentorship. By not dividing the team, her leadership style enticed the viewing audience to root for the team as a whole. Bring It was decided ot be an overall healthier environment compared to Dance Moms because it fostered growth rather than stifling emotional development. When asked to generalize, AI concluded that reality tv is not a safe environment for children because of the immense pressure and lack of protection against public scrutiny."

    "text": "There are numerous eating fads and workout routines available today, thanks to social platforms like YouTube and TikTok. Whenever I see a girl with an idealized physique pop up on my feed, the comments are filled with viewers asking for her gym routine and meal plan, even if the video is completely unrelated. While it’s great that people are thinking more consciously about their lifestyle habits, often, their motivations are rooted in aesthetics rather than overall health. Even with inclusive campaigns like the body positivity movement, body image still controls so many people, especially women, and thus, any new behaviors are merely temporary. I want to see if AI can help me uncover the secrets to establishing healthy habits, so that lifestyle changes can be maintained long-term. I’d also like to understand the role of mental health in these processes.\nClaude AI identified the following factors as drivers of the shift:\n\nSocial Media Algorithms Increased promotion of “girl routines” and “what I eat in a day” content\nVisibility of GLP-1 drugs (Ozempic, Wegovy)\nEconomic anxiety During times of uncertainty, people over-fixate on things they can control, like their bodies\nBacklash Fatigue body positivity themes became corporatized and seemingly performative\nGen Z entering their 20s\nWellness-to-ED Pipeline\n\nI then prompted AI to consider demographics as contributors to these trends,!\n\nSince more people are beginning to gravitate towards AI as their first source for quick questions about losing weight and changing their diets, how can AI intervene to push healthier habits?\n\nPersonalized health tracking (non-aesthetic)\n\n\nAI can monitor biomarkers, sleep quality, energy levels, strength gains, mental health indicators\nShift metrics from “pounds lost” to “improved HRV” or “better sleep scores”\nProblem: Most apps still center weight/appearance\n\n\nConversational AI coaching\n\n\nChatbots that challenge distorted thinking patterns (like CBT for EDs)\nCatch diet culture language and reframe it (“I need to be skinny” → - “What’s the actual concern here?”)\nProvide real-time intervention when users express disordered thoughts\n\n\nContent moderation & feed curation\n\n\nAI can identify and limit thinspo/fitspo content\nDeprioritize before/after photos, body checking content\nBoost educational health content over transformation content\nCurrently underused - platforms profit from engagement\n\n\nImage recognition for trigger warnings\n\n\nFlag potentially triggering content (extreme thinness, body checks)\nAllow users to filter their feeds proactively\nSome tools exist but aren’t mainstream\n\n\nPersonalized education\n\n\nAI tutors that teach HAES (Health At Every Size) principles\nExplain why BMI is flawed, how metabolic health ≠ size\nAdapt to user’s specific misconceptions\n\n\nPattern recognition in user behavior\n\n\nDetect early warning signs of disordered eating (obsessive logging, restriction patterns)\nGentle interventions before behaviors escalate\nConnect users to resources\n\nFinally, I was curious about the role that mental health has played in the cyclical nature of diet culture: 1. Emotional regulation - Without addressing the root emotion, any habit change feels like deprivation and fails. 2. Stress response - Chronic stress elevates cortisol, disrupts sleep, and kills motivation. 3. Self-worth baseline - If you hate yourself, “healthy habits” become punishment, which isn’t sustainable. Self-compassion predicts long-term success. 4. Executive function - Depression and ADHD impair planning, consistency, and follow-through. 5. All-or-nothing thinking - Anxiety breeds perfectionism. Mental flexibility is crucial."

    "text": "Growing up, my friends and I would take Buzzfeed quizzes to see which TV characters we were most like, which aesthetic fits us, what our personality types were, etc. These quizzes always set questions that used facts like our favorite foods and musical artists to produce an answer, but now that AI can come up with new introspective questions on the spot, I thought it would be fun if, using my answers to questions it comes up with, AI would be able to accurately guess my zodiac sign. I gave 2 different platforms the same prompt to see what kind of questions I got. Though the zodiac sign is a fun, light-hearted concept to test, some people use AI to figure out potential career paths and to make big decisions, so seeing the type of questions AI asks provides insight into how it uses context to respond to users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe systems produced different questions, but both asked about problem-solving style, how I respond to conflict, and other questions about how I conduct myself in my daily life to guess my Zodiac sign. Neither guessed correctly, but when I revealed my sign, both provided reasoning as to why my answers at least partially reflect what’s expected for the sign while also identifying deviations and explaining how a different answer to 1 question would have changed their conclusion. Both systems expanded on the reasoning and logic behind their guesses, unlike Buzzfeed quizzes. There is little need for Buzzfeed to provide reasoning for their results since the platform is used mainly by children, AI is often used for high stakes decision-making, thus users having insight into how responses are crafted are important for choosing whether or not to act on AI’s recommendations."

    "text": "Gen Z’s perception of the world is largely shaped by social media. From political views to love languages, to future profession opportunities, we form opinions by engaging with other people and considering their perspectives. The authority of social media on our lives is facilitated by influencers. Especially on TikTok, people can identify an area of interest upon which to center creative content, and with the help of the TikTok algorithm, many have the potential to become popular figures with the capabilities to profit from their videos. For many, higher education has grown increasingly unattractive as a next step following high school, causing them to attempt to become influencers as their full-time career. An important part of being a successful influencer is knowing your niche. Based on supplemental information about personality and interests, I’m curious to know what type of influencer AI thinks I should be if I wanted to maximize popularity.\nHere’s how the conversation went:\nMe: what type of influencer content is most popular amongst TikTok viewers\nCopilot:\nGRWM (Get Ready With Me): Especially in beauty and fashion, these videos blend routine with personality, often using trending sounds.\nTutorials & How-Tos: Quick, digestible guides—from makeup to productivity hacks—are highly engaging and shareable.\nChallenges & Trends: Participating in viral challenges or remixing trending formats boosts visibility and taps into TikTok’s algorithm.\nPOV & Storytelling: Creators use “POV” formats or short skits to share relatable experiences, often with humor or emotional depth.\nLifestyle Vlogs: Day-in-the-life clips, travel diaries, and personal routines help build parasocial connections.\nEdutainment: Educational content with an entertaining twist—especially in finance, tech, and wellness—is gaining traction.\nCopilot showed the same types of content to be the most profitable for newly established influencers.\nHere’s the personality/content survey I answered to determing which type of influencer I should be if I chose to follow that path!\n\n\nCo-pilot advised me to try drumroll Lifestyle and Edutainment Content!\nCopilot found the following types of content to be most popular and profitable for those trying to become influencers and even provided some explanation as to why they tend to resonate with audiences more than other video types. I think these types of creators benefit from the public’s craving for authenticity. We are constantly faced with big brands trying to paint themselves a certain way to incentivize purchases, so when we’re faced with genuine content, we’re appreciative of the vulnerability. Copoilot concluded that if I were to enter the influencer space, I would be most likely to succeed in one of the aforementioned disciplines. Though flattered by the idea of people being that invested in my day-to-day life, I’ve noticed that, recently, audiences have grown more parasocial and have even developed a sense of entitlement to being privy to the intimate details of public figures’ lives. It would be cool to be an influencer, but I need my privacy, so I think I’ll stick to a more practical career!"

Some sources argue that listening to classical music does in fact support brain function and retention of learning content, yet most young people turn to other genres such as pop, rap, or R&B while doing tasks. Do the alternative beats and inclusion of lyrics make these genres distracting when trying to learn or do they still have some facilitate learning to some degree?\nWhen evaluating how music affect, AI came to the following conclusions:\nAvoid Lyrics for Language-Based Tasks: Music with lyrics can interfere with reading comprehension or writing. Tempo Matters: Medium tempos (~60–80 bpm) tend to be most conducive to studying. Volume Is Key: Keep music at a lower volume to avoid overwhelming the brain. Know Yourself: Some people thrive with background music, while others need silence to focus. Tailor your study environment to your preferences.\nI wanted an estimate of how much information could be retained when listening to differrent genres of music and if the subject changes that nunmber…\n\nOverall, Classical music proved to be the best choice for retaining information, while pop, rock, and rap appear to be distracting. So next time you’re studying, consider listening to Symphony No. 9 instead if Drunk In Love"

    "text": "The smart technology war has featured Apple and Samsung for decades, with many consumers remaining loyal to one brand despite additional capabilities that the alternative may offer. The announcement of new features incentivizes the competition to find new ideas that will capture the audience’s attention, and their efforts are often successful. After all, we’re on the 17th iPhone. The recent launch of the iPhone 17 has once again sparked conversation on social media, with many saying that Apple is running out of ideas and that this may be the push they needed to switch over to Samsung. This prompts the question, what features are truly important to consumers when choosing a technology company? Do standards and capabilities matter more in different regions? Which brand would different LLMs decree to be better, and what characteristics are these choices based on?\nI asked two LLMs to choose 5 important features that consumers should consider when purchasing a smartphone and to rate Apple and Samsung’s performances in each area on a scale from 1-10.\n\n\nIt was interesting to see that they chose the same criteria, and that both identified Apple as the better option despite rating the individual qualities differently.\nLet’s look if each brand’s market share across regions aligns with AI’s rankings.\n\n\n\nAlthough Apple is significantly more popular in North America, Samsung still holds the larger global share.\nAfter ranking the operational capabilities of each brand’s smartphone, and evaluating the adoption of their products among diverse populations, AI recognizes Apple’s technology as superior."
